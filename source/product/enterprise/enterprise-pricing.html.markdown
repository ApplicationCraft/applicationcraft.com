##How many developer seats do I need and who needs seats?
Seats must be purchased for each individual in your organization that will have an account with the AC Enterprise system. This includes developers, project managers, designers, and other collaborators.

The AC Enterprise platform comes includes 10 developer seats. You can purchase additional blocks of 10 seats at the same price as the base AC Enterprise platform.

##Which payment methods are accepted?
Invoices are paid by Credit Card or Wire Transfer.

##How is AC Enterprise licensed?
AC Enterprise is licensed under a subscription model. Seats are purchased for a one-year period which includes access to all updates and upgrades. <a href="/legal/enterprise-license">Click here</a> to see the Enterprise license agreement.

How do I add more seats to my current license?
All upgrades are handled in your favor. We charge only for the difference in price between the number of seats you currently have and the number of seats you want to end up with. The cost of the new seats will be prorated for time remaining in your current license period, so your renewal dates for new seats will always coincide with your existing seats. You can initiate an upgrade order by clicking on the Buy More Seats button, or just contact us for assistance.

##Are licenses available for less than 10 seats?
No. Licenses must be purchased in 10 seat packs. You can always use AC Pro for smaller situations.

##We are a large company (100+ users). Do you have licensing options for us?
Yes. Contact us to speak to a sales representative about large installations.

##Does the license include access to the source code?
No. Licenses cover the use of the software only. Modification and redistribution are not permitted. Access to source code can be provided under a special agreement.
