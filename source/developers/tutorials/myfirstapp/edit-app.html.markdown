With your App selected in the left pane, click the Edit button. This will launch the IDE.

When the IDE appears, you will see an empty screen. Take a quick look at the way it is presented and note the key areas.

The things highlighted in red are the first things to be aware of

 - **Widget Toolbox** AC widgets are located in folders and can be dragged and dropped onto the page.
 - **Page**  This is where you can layout your screens. There are two main layout modes you should be aware of. Absolute Mode allows you to drag to the nearest pixel but the page size is essentially fixed. Vertical and Asbolute modes allow you to design screens that dynamically resize depending on the device screen size. To get a really good understanding of these modes you can watch some [Video Tutorials](/developers/training-videos/advanced-layout/) (Layout Mode explains Modes) or go to the [User Guide](/developers/documentation/product-guide/content-and-app-layout/responsive-adaptive-fluid-design/).
 - **Property Bar** You can modify properties of the selected widget on a page.
 - **Preview and Live Buttons** Press these to see your App running in the IDE window or a new window.
 - **Properties Button (top right)** to select the App itself so you can modify its properties in the Property Bar.
 - **Design & Code Buttons** located in the footer area, this allows you to switch to Code Mode or back to Design Mode. Use ctrl+d (or cmd+d a Mac) to toggle quickly.
 - **Events and Properties tabs** switch to Events for the selected widget and back. More on this later.
