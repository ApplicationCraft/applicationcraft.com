Now let's add some widgets to the page. We are going to keep this really simple but you can add as many as you'd like to have fun with.

##Absolute Mode
First of all, let's make sure your page is set to be in Absolute Mode, so you can freely drag and drop your widgets anywhere you like.

1. Click anywhere within the actual page but not on any widget.
1. In the Property Bar, locate the Layout property (labeled '1.' in the image) and change it to Absolute.
1. Now drag the Label widget (labeled 2.) into the page.
1. Do the same for the Text (labeled 3.) and Action Button (4.) widgets.
