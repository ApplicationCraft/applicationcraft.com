To cancel your account subscription, hover over your user name to select Cancel Subscription.

![CancelSub](/img/docs/cancelsub.png)

A check will be made to confirm the user account has the necessary privileges before allowing any changes to be made.

Before you can downgrade, you will need to ensure that you have no more than 10 apps in your account and only one active developer.

Please note: Developers do not need to be deleted entirely. In the event that you may want to upgrade again in future, you can disable developer users so their work/apps are not deleted but just not available while you continue as a Free user.

More information on cancelling your subscription is available [here](http://www.applicationcraft.com/legal-faqs)
