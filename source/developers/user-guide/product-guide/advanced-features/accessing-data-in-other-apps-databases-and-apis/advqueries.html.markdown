Queries are a central part of the Application Craft system when it comes an App needing to access data stored in any other external system such as a database.

The Query Editor lets you specify which Tables should be used and there is also the ability to specify JOINs.

Once a Query is defined, access permissions can be granted for security purposes and you can then expose the contents of the Query to App builders.

The beauty of a Query is that once it is setup, it can be left alone and re-used by any number of Apps.

Please refer to the [Query topic](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/queries/) in the Console Documentation for full details.
