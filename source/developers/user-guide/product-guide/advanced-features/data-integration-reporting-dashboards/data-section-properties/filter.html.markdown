Using the Expression Builder you can specify a static filter that can be added to the View filter when that Widget requests data. It will not affect any other Widgets that share the same View.

## Modifying the Filter from a Script

A script is able to modify a Filter that always applies to the Widget. Please refer to the [Data Views chapter](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/data-view-functions/) of the [Client API](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/) section for more information.
