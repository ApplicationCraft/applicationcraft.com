With your Data List created, you now need to create an Application Craft Query in the normal way. This is described in the [Data Integration](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/advanced-features/data-integration-reporting-dashboards/) section.

In the [Query Wizard](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/queries/query-wizard/) , you can see in the left Â hand pane a tab labeled 'Lists'. All Data List type Resources will be listed there. You select a List and then press the '\>\>\>' button to add it to your Query.

From this point onwards, the process of Query creation is the same as for all Queries, as described [here](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/queries/) .
