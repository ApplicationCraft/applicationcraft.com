Data Lists are created and managed form the Resources tab of the Application Craft Console. Press the New button at the top of the Resources list on the left side.

There are then two ways to create you Data List.

Create an Empty List

You would create an empty list if you want to manage small lookup tables that you can then edit from the Console. You would load your list data into Application Craft Widgets using the Data Integration features.

Once created, you can edit the content of your list by pressing the Edit Content button in the right pane.

Uploading a CSV File

If you already have your data in a table or spreadsheet, you should export it from the source location as a CSV file. You then select the 'Upload' option from the dialog and upload the file into the Resource.

Once loaded, you can also edit the content with the Edit Content button.
