This lets you load a list directly into an array in your App's Javascript code

    sys.getListResource("393cd563-72a4-4404-89f7-af7e7faaa16f",Â callBackFunction);
   

If you want to search your Data Lists or do more sophisticated operations such as Filter, Group By, OrderBy then you should create a Data View in your App and use AC's general [Data Integration](../data-integration,-reporting-dashboards/index) features.
