You do not need to use the Tokens dialog to translate. You can switch the display language in the IDE by selecting the dropdown in the top menu bar. You will find all languages listed there and simply select the language you want to see.

If languages have been added but no translations have been carried out, then you will be shown the default language in the Widgets. This is a really nice way to see what has been translated and what has not.

You can then modify the appropriate text properties for the currently selected language as an alternative way of translating You will see afterwards that the string table will have been modified.

An App set to its default language, English in this case.

See how the App Language drop-down (top right of screen) has been changed to Russian. Russian speakers, please forgive linguistic inaccuracies as this only used auto-translate.
