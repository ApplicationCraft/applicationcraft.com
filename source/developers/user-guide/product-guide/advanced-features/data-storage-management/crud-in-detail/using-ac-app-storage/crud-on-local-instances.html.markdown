IMPORTANT

## WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../../../data-storage/server-side-data-storage/index)

## WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.

The functions [instanceCreate()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancecreate) , [instanceUpdate()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesave) and [instanceDelete()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancedelete) can operate on Local App data as described above. For all functions, if you do not define the first parameter or leave the string empty, Application Craft will operate on local Widgets.
