IMPORTANT

**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS  FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

Provided you have set the App’s Storage property to something other than ‘none’, AC will list your App here. Having located your App, you will find an entry within it called 'Basic Data'. This contains the basic Instance data only, but no individual field data.

 - Form Instance ID (id\_form\_instance) - this is an ID that uniquely identifies the App Instance across any AC system, not just the local system.

 - Title - this is the Instance Name as discussed earlier in this chapter

 - Content - this is a sequential ID that is unique within the local AC system only

 - Time Created - this field contains the date and time that the Instance was created
