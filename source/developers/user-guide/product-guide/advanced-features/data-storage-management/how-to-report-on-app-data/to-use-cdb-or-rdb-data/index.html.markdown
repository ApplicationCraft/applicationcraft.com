IMPORTANT

**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS  FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

Depending on how you set the App’s Storage property, you can report on CDB and/or RDB data.

 - Save Instances - this guarantees that the CDB data can be reported on as described below. See [Instance (CDB) Data](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/advanced-features/data-storage-management/how-to-report-on-app-data/to-use-cdb-or-rdb-data/instance-cdb-data)

 - Save Instances and add to Reporting - this allows you to also report on individual fields within the App. See [Reporting (RDB) Data](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/advanced-features/data-storage-management/how-to-report-on-app-data/to-use-cdb-or-rdb-data/reporting-rdb-data)
