## WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../../data-storage/server-side-data-storage/index.htm)

## WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.

Reporting on your App data is straightforward. You work with Application Craft App data in exactly the same way as you would with any other sort of data.

Because AC obviously understands its own data setup you do not need to define any Connections. You simply set up a Query directly. From the screenshot below, you can see that when you press the Edit button to bring up the Query dialog, there is an Apps tab next to the Connections tab. All of the Apps are listed here where you have permission to define queries.

To see how to set up your App to work with Data see [Configuring the App to Access Queries](../../data-integration,-reporting-dashboards/data-section-properties/configuring-the-app-to-access-.htm)
