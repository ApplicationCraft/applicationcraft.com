IMPORTANT

**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

In many cases, you will want to manage your Instances using Javascript. The following commands are available within the [Instance](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/) chapter of the Javascript API Reference.

 - [instanceCreate()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancecreate)
 - [instanceUpdate()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesave)
 - [instanceDelete()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancedelete)
 - [instanceNew()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancenew)
 - [instanceLoad(instanceID, onInstanceLoaded)](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instanceload)
