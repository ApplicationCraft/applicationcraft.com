IMPORTANT

## WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../../../data-storage/server-side-data-storage/index.htm)

## WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.

In many cases, you will want to manage your Instances using Javascript. The following commands are available within the [Instance](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/index.htm) chapter of the Javascript API Reference.

 - [instanceCreate()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancecreate.htm)

 - [instanceUpdate()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesave.htm)

 - [instanceDelete()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancedelete.htm)

 - [instanceNew()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancenew.htm)

 - [instanceLoad(instanceID, onInstanceLoaded)](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instanceload.htm)
