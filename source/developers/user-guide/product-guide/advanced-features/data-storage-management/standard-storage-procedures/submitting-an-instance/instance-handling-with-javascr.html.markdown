**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../../../data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

In many cases, you will want to manage your Instances using Javascript. The following commands are available within the [Instance](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/) chapter of the Javascript API Reference.

 - [instanceCreate()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancecreate)

 - [instanceUpdate()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesave)

 - [instanceDelete()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancedelete)

 - [instanceNew()](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancenew)

 - [instanceLoad(instanceID, onInstanceLoaded)](../../../../../scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instanceload)
