IMPORTANT

## WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS  FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../../../../../data-storage/server-side-data-storage/index)

## WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.

Once the Instance has been successfully saved, the App will not change appearance, by default. However, there are several things you can do in the [Application Properties](../../../../../../../widget-properties-events/app-properties#advanced) to modify the behavior upon successful submission.

 - Redirect to a page in the App - use the App’s Page Target property to specify the name of the Page that should be redirected to.

 - Redirect to a new URL - the browser will redirect to the URL specified in the App property Redirect URL .

You can also redirect to another Page in the App or to another URL using scripting.
