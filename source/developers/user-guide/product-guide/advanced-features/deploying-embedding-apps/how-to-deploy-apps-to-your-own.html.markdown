On the [Apps](../../the-console/console-tabs/applications.htm) console screen is the Download action button.

This will download the app source code to your PC within a zip file. Extract the contents of this zip and copy/move them to the required location on your own webserver. Â Reference the index.html file to access the app.

Please note that if deploying to an IIS webserver you may need to configure the server to allow the return of \*.json files. It is not enabled by default.
