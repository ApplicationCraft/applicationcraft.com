The quickest way to see this in action is to locate the App in the Console and then press 'Live Mode' in the right pane. This will launch a new browser window with the App in it. If you examine the URL, it will look something like this

    http://yourdomain.applicationcraft.com/live.php?formId=6bbef3ec-1f93-4b8c-9f7d-bfce1365842c
   

You can replace the formID component with any App GUID you like.

You can also access this URL from the [Apps](../../the-console/console-tabs/applications) console.

You can also set a Custom URL ID, where you can choose a 'short name' for your app so the URL is more manageable.

for example where your URL will be ac.applicationcraft.com/de3c544d-0cda-4cab-970adc9fbea72fe3, you can now choose your own short format name, such as ‘survey’ so the URL becomes a much more manageable ‘ac.applicationcraft.com/survey'

A Short URL and QR Code is also available
