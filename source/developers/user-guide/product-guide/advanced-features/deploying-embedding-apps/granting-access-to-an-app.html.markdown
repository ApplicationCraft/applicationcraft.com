Of course, when you've finished your App, you're going to want to share it with other Users. Please refer to the [Sharing](../../the-console/sharing.htm) section for advanced details on granting access to your App.

For example, setting the User Group Everyone to Allow both Use and Create Instances, would mean that any User could submit data through your App.
