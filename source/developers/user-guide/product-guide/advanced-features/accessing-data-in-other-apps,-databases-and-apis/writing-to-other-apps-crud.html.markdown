**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

In many cases, you will want to allow your App to write to another App's data store. We offer a range of 'CRUD' functions that make this very easy indeed. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) not only does the basic data operations but it also handles Relationships automatically as well as obeying integrity rules.

Please refer to the [CRUD in Detail](../data-storage-management/crud-in-detail/) section for a comprehensive overview.
