**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

To access a Query, all you need to do is to tell your Apps which Queries it should use by defining the App's Views. This is easily done via the 'View' App property. This is [described in detail from this topic onwards](../data-integration,-reporting-dashboards/data-section-properties/configuring-the-app-to-access)

With our [CRUD support](../data-storage-management/crud-in-detail/) , you can also write to other Apps data via a Query. This lets you build really powerful, relational Apps with incredible ease.
