If you want to access 3rd party Web Services, then AC offers some really easy to use functions that make life quick and easy.

[httpRequest()](../../../scripting-apis/client-api/soap-restful-ajax-calls/httprequest.htm) and [soapRequest()](../../../scripting-apis/client-api/soap-restful-ajax-calls/soaprequest.htm) are the functions you should look at.

Server Side functions are also available. See [Web Service Calls](../../../scripting-apis/server-side-api/ssj-object/web-service-calls/index.htm)
