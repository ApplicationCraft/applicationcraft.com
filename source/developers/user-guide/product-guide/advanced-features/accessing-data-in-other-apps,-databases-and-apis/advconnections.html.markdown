A Connection sits in between a [Query](advqueries.htm) and the database Agent. Connections are most likely to be used for accessing databases, so you can define standard database connection parameters.

If you build your own Integration Agent, you will still need a Connection to sit in between the Query and the Agent but it will likely not need any settings unless your Agent offers the ability to talk to different data sources.

Please refer to the [Container topic](containers.htm) in the Console Documentation for full details.
