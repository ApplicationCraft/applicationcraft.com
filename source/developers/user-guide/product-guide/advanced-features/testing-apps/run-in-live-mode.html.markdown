Live Mode allows you to final test your App in a pop-up window. Before running in Live Mode, you must ensure that permissions are set correctly for the App in the Console. Users who have Submit Instances enabled can use the App and submit data, and those who have Instance Access will be able to access the data from the App.

When you have completed your testing, you can delete all the test app data using the [Purge](../../the-console/console-tabs/applications#purge) option in the App designer view
