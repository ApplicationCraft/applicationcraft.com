You can upload a .css file to your Application Craft account as a [Resource](../../the-console/console-tabs/resources.htm) and then use that within your apps by entering it as a "Preload file"

![preloadFile](/img/docs/preloadfile.zoom78.png)

Select the 'Add row' and insert path to css file resource. This will ensure that library is fully loaded before the app starts. Please note that this code will not be available in Preview mode
