If you want to generate revenue from Ads inside your Mobile Apps then you need to do the following steps

## Signing Up for your Adfonic Account

Before you use your Advertising Widget, you should create an account by clicking [here](http://adfonic.com/sign-up) . For it to work smoothly with Application Craft, please be sure to create your account from the link below

Create your Adfonic Account here: [http://adfonic.com/sign-up](http://adfonic.com/sign-up)

## How do I get paid? How can I see activity?

You get 100% of the advertising revenue from Adfonic and you have the relationship with them directly. All revenue generated by you will be paid directly to you.

When you sign up, you also specify your bank details so you can get by directly paid by Adfonic.

There are also reporting tools that let you monitor your ad activity in real time ( [http://adfonic.com/sites-and-apps/reporting](http://adfonic.com/sites-and-apps/reporting) )

## Create an Adfonic Campaign

You should follow the instructions on their site for creating an Ad Campaign: [http://adfonic.com/sites-and-apps/add-site-or-app](http://adfonic.com/sites-and-apps/add-site-or-app)

This campaign will create a Campaign ID which you will need to paste into your Advertising widget.

If your app is targeted specifically for iOS and/or Android you can of course select the specific Publication Type, but where you may be intending cross platform usage, select Publication type: Other, and enter the URL to your app.

It is recommended that you use Custom URL ID where you can choose a 'short name' for your app. See [Apps](../the-console/console-tabs/applications) This will help Adfonic to review your app as an Application Craft app.

Entering a description of your app can also help speed up the approval process of your app.

## Ad Integration

Having set up your site or app, you now need to Integrate your ad for verification. Go to Ad Integration, select your site/app and the ad slot.

Make a note of the Unique Identifier as this is what you need to enter in the Campaign ID property of the Advertising Widget

## Insert Advertising Widget

You are now ready to insert your Advertising Widget, which is located in the Pro section of the AC toolbox. You should then click on the 'Advertising' property located in the Style property section. You will see the following dialog:

![ad-widget-properties](/img/docs/ad-widget-properties.png)

You must paste in the Campaign ID (see above: Unique Identifier). You can leave this blank, but if you do, an Ad will appear and the revenue will be credited to Application Craft, so be sure to switch to your own Campaign ID as soon as your App goes live.

The 'Hide Ad after' value tells Application Craft to hide the Ad after the indicated number of seconds.

The other fields are (hopefully) self-explanatory and are use to help Ad targeting.

## Verification of Ad Slot

Save your app and run it on your mobile device to verify the Ad Slot.

Even if you are planning to deploy your app as Native app you can still accomplish this by running your app as a web app on your device.

After a short period of time you will see in the advertising widget a message to indicate your Ad Slot has been verified.

Return to your Adfonic account and you should then also see the Ad Slot Details 'Status' is now verified.

Your site/app will now be reviewed for approval by Adfonic and you will be advised usually within 24 hours.
