If you want that an App should use a specific Google Analytics ID other than the default set up in the previous section, then you should set the 'Google Analytics Account ID' property within the Advanced section of the App properties.

To find get your GA Account ID, login to your GA account and then select Analytics Settings from the top left. You will see a code like UA-xxxxxxx-x which you can copy and paste.
