If you want your GA tracking to be javascript free, then you should set the 'Google Analytics Track Code' property for any page you like within your App.

Each page can have a different Tracking Code if you like or you can just have one at the destination or goal page.

If you want to be more sophisticated then our API offers the app.gaTrack() function that let's you send the tracking code in any way you like

.
