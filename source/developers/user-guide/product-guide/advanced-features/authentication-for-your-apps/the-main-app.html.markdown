To make for a complete example yet keep things simple, we have another App 'Signup Signin Main App' that we can think of as the main or home page of the overall application. It doesn't do a lot and looks like this :

![authentication-main-app](/img/docs/authentication-main-app.png)

This App is redirected to (as described later) upon successful signup or signin. If it is launched directly, it will automatically launch (also described in a moment) the 'Signup Signin' authentication App before running properly.
