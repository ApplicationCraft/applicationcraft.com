Captcha Verification prevents automated software from accessing your Apps. Â You can edit the appearance of the Captcha text by setting the Dots Level and Lines Level properties. These properties adjust the amount of noise in the Captcha.

The Signup Widget's 'Captcha' property points to this Widget so AC can automatically manage the verification during the Signup process.
