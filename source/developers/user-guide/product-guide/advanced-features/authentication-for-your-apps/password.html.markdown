The Password Widget is an intelligent Widget that does more than displaying '\*' characters. It can be referred to by the Signup Widget as the field to get a password from when creating a new user account.

It is also able to show the entered Password Strength. In the screenshot below, you can see the Password Widget selected and on the right hand side the 'Strength Label' property points to a Label Widget (named lblPwStr) where the entered password strength should be displayed.

You can optionally use the Strength Colors property to control the color that the label should be set to depending on the actual strength.
