There are a large number of Widgets that are capable of accessing a View.

Single Field Widgets

These are fields that can hold a single data value. As such, they will be linked to either a) an aggregate function such as Sum() or Count() that aggregate many rows of data into a single total or number. or b) a filtered query that only returns a single row of data, from which one field is taken.

 - [Group](../../content-and-app-layout/editing-and-laying-out--reference/widget-grouping)

 - [Radio Button](../../../widget-properties-events/common/radio-button)

 - [Checkbox](../../../widget-properties-events/common/checkbox)

 - [Label](../../../widget-properties-events/common/label)

 - [Text](../../../widget-properties-events/common/text)

 - [Text Area](../../../widget-properties-events/common/text-area)

 - [Numeric Text](../../../widget-properties-events/common/alpha-numeric)

 - [Image](../../../widget-properties-events/common/image)

 - [Date Picker](../../../widget-properties-events/common/date-picker)

 - [Mask Edit](../../../widget-properties-events/advanced/mask-edit)

 - [Sliders](../../../widget-properties-events/advanced/sliders)

Dual Field Widgets

 - [Drop Down List](../../../widget-properties-events/common/dropdown-list)

 - [Listbox](../../../widget-properties-events/common/listbox)

These Widgets hold a pair of fields. The Item Label is what is displayed for each list item and the Item Value (which defaults to being the same as the Label) is a secondary value that can be used for setting filters or using in calculations.

Grids

Grids can display multiple fields of data over multiple rows. They are very widely used for both collecting and displaying data.

Charts

Application Craft offers a [Flot Charts](../../../widget-properties-events/advanced/flot-charts) . More advanced Charting widgets will be coming soon

Configuring Widgets

These Widgets are highly configurable and allow almost data to be analyzed and beautifully rendered. The next sections deal with how to make the correct property settings.
