Other than Data Management and Workflow type Apps, the most common types of App are Business Intelligence Apps. These types of Apps are focused on displaying data from external data sources.

For Application Craft, an App is just an App. AC does not have any one special action you take that makes an App a reporting or Business Intelligence type App. It is just what you do with the Widgets and data sources that determines the type of App.

In general, though, Business Intelligence type Apps will involve common actions that a designer will take.
