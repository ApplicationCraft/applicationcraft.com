This feature is a major time saver and is available within the Fields property Expression Editor. If you are editing a Widget's Fields for the first time, you will see at the bottom of the dialog a collapsible section called 'Automatic Property Settings' that is expanded.

Application Craft suggests other property settings you might want it to make for you when you click the Apply button. Note that any items with the checkbox unchecked will clear that property. You must remember to actually click the Apply button in order to enable the changes.

With Chart Widgets, the suggestions made will differ for Label and Value, so check both to see which is most appropriate. If, for example, you were displaying the distribution of customers by country in a pie chart, you would want to have the 'label' item selected before clicking the Apply button.

While Application Craft will make good suggestions in many cases, you should be fully aware of how the [Group By](fiieldsgroup-by.htm) and [Drill Filter](drill-filter.htm) properties work as this offers real power. However you must be careful to ensure the Widgets are correctly configured to ensure the correct data is displayed.
