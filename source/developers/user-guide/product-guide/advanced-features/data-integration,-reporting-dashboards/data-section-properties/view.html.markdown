Many Widgets are able to take data from a View. Whether a Grid, showing many rows of data, a Pie Chart showing a data series or a simple text field showing a total or a field value, you will need to associate the Widget with a View.

The View Property will present you with the Queries that were selected within the App's 'Views' property.

If you need to access data that spans several data tables, then you set this up as a part of the [Data Query](../../../the-console/console-tabs/queries/index.htm) in the Console. This keeps the data management within the App clean and simple and ensure re-usability of data configurations.
