This is work in progress and will be enhanced with more functionality to deliver a better user experience.

If you want to offer a fully tailored experience, you can also display Assignments in an App. Please refer to the next section [Viewing Assignments in Apps](accessing-assignments-in-queri.htm) for more details.
