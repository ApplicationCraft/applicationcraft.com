Zooz offers a Sandbox mode so you can test your payments. See the sample code to see how this is handled. You can see this in the [Server Side Code](server-side-code) example where you will see [ssj.zooz.payment()](../../../scripting-apis/server-side-api/ssj-object/credit-card-payments/payment) and [ssj.zooz.validate()](../../../scripting-apis/server-side-api/ssj-object/credit-card-payments/validate) both offer an

    isSandbox
   

parameter.
