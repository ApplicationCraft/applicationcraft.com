Although all the Mobile Widgets are in one Toolbox section we have arbitrarily divided them into two groups

 - Standard Mobile Widgets - these behave similarly to other non-mobile Widgets but are designed to look and behave well on Mobile devices

 - Advanced Mobile Widgets - these have features that makes them especially important when running on a mobile device

All Mobile Widgets work very well in desktop browsers, so you can build successful cross-platform apps just using Mobile Widgets.

Mobile Widgets generally look Native depending on the device they are running on. An Android list looks as it should on an Android device and is different from the way that the same list renders on an iPhone.

Checkbox & Checkbox Group

These work very well on touch screens.

Radio Buttons Group

Again, touch optimised for mobile devices.

Collapsible Content

This, along with the Mobile Accordion, allows you to place content into a container that can be collapsed and expanded again when the header is clicked on.

You should be aware that it is not possible to change the height of this widget. The height property refers to the collapsed height and is fixed. The expanded height is variable and depends on the content within the container. You can use the Margin property to adapt the spacing between individual Collapsible widgets.

Popup Dropdown

This allows a single selection to be made from list that appears as a popup. It acts much the same as the Desktop Dropdown widget.

Popup Listbox

Allows multiple selections to be made from a popup list. It acts much the same as a Listbox widget with its Multi Select property set to true.

Accordion

This acts like several Collapsible Content widgets stacked upon one another.

Slider

A touch friendly slider widget with value display field attached.

Flip Toggle Switch

An on/off type switch widget.

Text, Text Area

Much as you would imagine for single or multi-line text input.

## Context Menu

The Context Menu widget can be used to show a simple pop up selection box

## Mobiscroll

A scroller style date/time picker optimized for touch devices such as iPhone, iPad, Android, to easily enter date and/or time
