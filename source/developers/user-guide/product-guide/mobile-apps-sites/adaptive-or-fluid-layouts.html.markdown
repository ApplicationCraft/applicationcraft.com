Before you start building a mobile application, it is strongly recommended that you have a thorough understanding of how to build fully flexible layouts. The [Content and Layout](../content-and-app-layout/) chapter is the place to head for instructions on how to do this.

If you want to design applications that run on desktop, tablet and smartphones, then [Adaptive Layout](../content-and-app-layout/responsive-/-adaptive-/-fluid-design/) is a topic that must be understood.
