A very nice feature is the ability to add event/task data to the Calendar using a Data View. This enables you to use Application Craft's integration features to access events that are stored within a database table.

If you are not familiar with Data Views, then please refer to the [Data Integration](../../advanced-features/data-integration,-reporting-dashboards/index) and [Accessing Data in other Apps and Databases](../../advanced-features/accessing-data-in-other-apps,-databases-and-apis/index) sections.
