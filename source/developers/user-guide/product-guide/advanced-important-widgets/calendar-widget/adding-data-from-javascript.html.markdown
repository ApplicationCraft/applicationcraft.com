To add tasks or events to the Calendar Widget, you can use a Javascript array and then pass the data in using [populateWidget()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-data-state-manipulation/populatewidget/) . The nice thing about populateWidget() is that you can map data from almost any array without having to first prepare your data in a very precise format.

Please [click here](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-data-state-manipulation/populatewidget/calendar-widget2) to see how populateWidget() works for the Calendar Widget.
