You can also populate your Zingchart Widget using a Data View. This enables you to use Application Craft's integration features to access data stored within a database table.

If you are not familiar with Data Views, then please refer to the [Data Integration](../../advanced-features/data-integration,-reporting-dashboards/) and [Accessing Data in other Apps and Databases](../../advanced-features/accessing-data-in-other-apps,-databases-and-apis/) sections.
