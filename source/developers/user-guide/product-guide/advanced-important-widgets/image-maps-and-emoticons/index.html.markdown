The [Image](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/widget-properties-events/common/image) widget in Application Craft has some very useful features.

[Image Maps](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/image-maps-and-emoticons/image-maps) where you can define areas in your images, store these selections and/or carry out dynamic functions as users select the area(s). As users 'hover' over your defined areas they can be 'highlighted' and the caption for this area shown as well

[Emoticons](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/image-maps-and-emoticons/emoticons) can provide a visual presentation to users of their selection from the Slider widget
