Normally, list items are used to navigate between content or to list records of data. However, in some case you may want to use the list to control content displayed on the same page (in another panel, for example). In this case, you would want the selected list item to change color to clearly indicate that it has been pressed.

To enable this, you must set the 'Highlight Selected' property (General section at the top of the property bar) to true.
