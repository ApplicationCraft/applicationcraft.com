The Photoswipe Widget enables you to load images and thumbnails into a widget that performs two functions

 - Thumbnail Tiles - it arranges the images in an array of thumbnails

 - Swipe-able Full Images - this is the really cool part and is designed to work beautifully on mobile devices. It also works very nicely on desktop browsers.

Tile View - the user clicks and then you get full    window viewing ...

</td>
<td width="11">
</td>
<td width="313">
![swipe-buttons](/img/docs/swipe-buttons.zoom69.png)

... as shown here. You can swipe, drag or use the keyboard. Buttons fade away.

</tr>
</table>
