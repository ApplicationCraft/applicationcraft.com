A very nice feature is the ability to add images in the Photoswipe Widget using a Data View. This enables you to use Application Craft's integration features to access image data stored within a database table.

If you are not familiar with Data Views, then please refer to the [Data Integration](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/advanced-features/data-integration-reporting-dashboards/) and [Accessing Data in other Apps and Databases](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/advanced-features/accessing-data-in-other-apps-databases-and-apis/) sections.

The example below pulls the image title, thumbnail image url (shown in the actual screenshot) and actual image resource url from a Data View and populates the Photoswipe widget.
