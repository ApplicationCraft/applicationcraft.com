If you get your data back from an [httpRequest()](../../../scripting-apis/client-api/soap-restful-ajax-calls/httprequest.htm) call or some other means, then you will have your data in an array that contains the urls of your images. This is where the good old [populateWidget()](../../../scripting-apis/client-api/widget-data-state-manipulation/populatewidget()/index.htm) method comes in.

Please [click here](../../../scripting-apis/client-api/widget-data-state-manipulation/populatewidget()/photoswipe-example.htm) to see an example of a Photoswipe widget being populated from an array.
