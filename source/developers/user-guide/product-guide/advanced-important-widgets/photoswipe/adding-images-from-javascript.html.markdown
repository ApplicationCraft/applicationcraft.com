If you get your data back from an [httpRequest()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/soap-restful-ajax-calls/httprequest) call or some other means, then you will have your data in an array that contains the urls of your images. This is where the good old [populateWidget()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-data-state-manipulation/populatewidget/) method comes in.

Please [click here](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-data-state-manipulation/populatewidget/photoswipe-example) to see an example of a Photoswipe widget being populated from an array.
