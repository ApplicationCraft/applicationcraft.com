The Panel Container is a special Container that allows multiple Widgets that are contained by it to reference the Data View that the container is pointed to.

If you are viewing a selected Instance from a foreign App, for example, you can set a drill-down to automatically get data for the selected Instance and populate the container's child Widgets without writing a single line of code.
