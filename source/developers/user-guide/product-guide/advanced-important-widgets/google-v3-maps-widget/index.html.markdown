The purpose of this widget is to make working with maps as easy as it possibly can be. This means not just the visual map but also the many methods that the Google V3 Maps and Geocoding API incorporates. This includes

 - Adding Markers and configuring marker icons and popup panels

 - Lines and Polygons

 - Latitude/Longitude -\> Address lookup (Reverse Geocoding)

 - Address -\> Latitude/Longitude (Geocoding)

 - Adding circles and rectangles to maps

 - Full control over zoom, pan via the visual map and using javascript

 - Getting directions

 - Data Integration support so you can build an Application Craft query and then populate markers directly to a map

 - [populateWidget()](google-v3-maps-widget/using-populatewidget) support allowing easy mapping of any JSON data structure to a map
