Google Maps is where you enter your Google Maps API key for the [Google Maps Advanced](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/widget-properties-events/advanced/google-maps-advanced) widget, where you set your API key to use for tracking, use other paid services. or to prevent free(no Api key) restrictions. This key will be used on all Google Maps within your account.

If you wish to use alternative keys for specific maps these can be set in the Google API Key property (see below)

Sign up for your Google Map API key here: [https://developers.google.com/maps/signup](https://developers.google.com/maps/signup)
