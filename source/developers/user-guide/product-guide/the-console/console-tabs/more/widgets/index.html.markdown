There are two different types of widgets you can add to the default selection that are available in the IDE

 - 3rd Party widgets - these are widgets that are offered as simple javascript plugins to any web site. Youtube, Disqus, Cinch, Â Twitter and many other products and sites offer these widgets. There is a good example of how to do this in the [following section](/developers/user-guide/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/more/widgets/adding-a-3rd-party-widget) .

 - Native Application Craft widgets - you can build full featured widgets that have the exact same architecture as our own widgets. These are much more tightly integrated into the Application Craft framework. Please refer to [Extending Application Craft](/developers/user-guide/adding-widgets-and-api-methods/) for information on how to build these Native Application Craft widgets.

The following two sections cover how to add these Widgets into the Console.
