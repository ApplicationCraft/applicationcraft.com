For those of you who are familiar with ETL, we are very pleased to be partnering with Clover Data Solutions and their excellent product Clover ETL. This is a full blown ETL solution that is exceptionally fast and highly configurable.

For readers who are not familiar with ETL (Extract Transform Load), it allows you to perform very rapid and often highly complex data transformations on multiple data sources.

Clover ETL allows you to build graphical data transformations like the one shown above and run these in one of two ways. You can either run them locally from the Graph Designer (Desktop Edition) or you can deploy them to a server (Enterprise Edition), where you get high end functionality such as scheduling, exception handling, logging and more. The flagship system is the Clover Cluster Edition that is massively scalable and is suited to processing vast amounts of data.
