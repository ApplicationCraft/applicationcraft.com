As with most other centrally managed Application Craft objects, an Integration Agent is private when created and so, by default, it can only be used by Connections created by the user who created and owns the Data Agent.

However, in most cases an Administrator will create a Data Agent that should be accessible by AC Users for their Apps. In this case, with the Data Agent selected in the list on the left side, expand the Sharing section on the right and then assign it to Users and Groups. You can then select the appropriate permissions for those Users and Groups.

If you want to make a shared Agent Public, you can drag it into a Public folder. Note that being in the Public folder does not make it accessible to all users, it merely makes shared Agents visible within the context of a Public folder structure. If you want an Agent to be available to everyone, use Sharing to grant permissions to the Group 'Everyone' before dragging it into the Public folder.
