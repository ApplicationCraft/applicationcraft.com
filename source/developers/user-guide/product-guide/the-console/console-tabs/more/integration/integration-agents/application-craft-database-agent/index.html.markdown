An Application Craft Database Agent is installed by default alongside the AC system for connecting to local data sources. The Agent is a simple PHP web App that can be installed on Windows, Linux or MAC OS X platforms and allows any AC system, local or remote, to exchange data with most databases including:

 - MySQL
 - Postgres
 - MS-SQL
 - Oracle
 - SQLite

Application Craft itself automatically installs a local database Agent so local databases can be interacted with. You may purchase additional AC Database Agents to install at remote locations, should you need to interact securely with data at multiple locations.
