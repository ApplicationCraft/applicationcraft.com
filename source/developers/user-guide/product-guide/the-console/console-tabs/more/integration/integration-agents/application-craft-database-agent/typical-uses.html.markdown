The following list describes some of the things you can do with AC Integration:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="145">
Lookups

</td>
<td width="15">
</td>
<td width="675">
This is probably the most common use of Integration. In many cases, you will want to populate a list or a grid with data that resides in another database or system. When the App user selects an item, you can load field data from that data source directly into your App Instance.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="145">
Adding New Records

</td>
<td width="15">
</td>
<td width="675">
Your App may collect data from the App user that then needs to be added to a data source.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="145">
Updates

</td>
<td width="15">
</td>
<td width="675">
You can load data from a data source, edit it and then update the original data in the data source.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="145">
Delete

</td>
<td width="15">
</td>
<td width="675">
Delete data records from your data source if your App allows the user to do so

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="145">
Stored Procedure

</td>
<td width="15">
</td>
<td width="675">
You can pass data from your App to a Stored Procedure

</td>
</tr>
</table>

When you apply these actions to the many data source types, you can see how you now have opened up all sorts of opportunities for accessing and managing data in a way that would have been very difficult and fiddly in the past.
