We provide support for all of the common database types including MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQL-Server, Sybase, DB2, SQLite. If your favorite database is not in this list then do not despair. If you can find a good quality JDBC/ODBC driver, the chances are it will work. Custom connectors can also be built.
