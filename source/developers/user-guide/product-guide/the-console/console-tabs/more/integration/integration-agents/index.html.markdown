The Integration Agent is the plug-in component that Application Craft uses in order to access all external data systems, whether local or remote. For example, a Facebook Integration Agent will access the Facebook data domain.

An AC Database Agent is installed by default alongside the main system as well as optionally at remote locations and can access most database systems (see [Application Craft Database Agent](application-craft-database-agent/index.htm) ). Integration Agents are usually configured by your AC System Administrator and permissions can be applied to restrict access.

Developers can build their own Integration Agents and plug these into AC.

Once installed, you need to configure the Agent within AC as described [here](configuring-integration-agents-within-ac/index.htm) .
