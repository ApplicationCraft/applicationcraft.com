Having installed a Integration Agent, it now needs to be registered and configured within Application Craft. This is done from the Console. Click on Home at the top of the Console window and then locate the Integration Agents option in the central column of the Console.

As with most centrally managed objects, Application Craft uses the [Private/Shared/Public folder structure](../../../../../private-shared-and-public-fol) to organize your Integration Agents. You can assign permissions in order to control access amongst AC Users.
