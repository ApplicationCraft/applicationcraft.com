Resources are static files that are used within or by Apps, the beauty being that you can upload your images, videos or files into the Resource Repository once and use them in all of your Apps. The most common usage is for images that appear in your Apps. The Resource types supported are:

 - Images (jpg, gif, png, tif, svg)

 - Data List. See [Data Lists Management](../../advanced-features/data-lists-management/)

 - Video (mpeg, mp4, ogg, quicktime, x-msvideo, x-matroska)

 - Audio (mpeg, ogg, x-flac)

 - Document (doc, pdf, opendoc, openxml, xls)

 - Archive (RAR & ZIP files)

 - Mail Merge (coming soon)

 - Report (coming soon)

 - Other

## Resource Repository

All Resources are stored in the standard Private/Shared/Public folder structure as [described here](../private-shared-and-public-fol) in more detail.

## Adding a Resource

When you add a new Resource by clicking on the New Object icon beneath the tree view, you are asked to enter the location from where the Resource should be taken. You have the following options

 - Link to URL - this will leave the resource where it is currently located and link to it

 - Copy from URL - this will copy the Resource from the specified location and load it into the system

 - Upload File - this will upload a file from your file system into AC

 - Empty - Create an empty Data List file. See: [Creating a Data List](../../advanced-features/data-lists-management/creating-a-data-list)
