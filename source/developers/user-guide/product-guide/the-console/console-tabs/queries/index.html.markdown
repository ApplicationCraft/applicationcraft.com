A Query is a collection of fields taken from a Connection/App or List. The Query Wizard allows you to define which fields are used. In the case of a database, a query can point directly to a table or a view. You can also define your own table joins in the AC Query Wizard so you don't have to set them up in the database if they don't already exist there.

Query Repository

All Queries are stored in the standard [Private/Shared/Public](../../private--shared-and-public-fol.htm) folder structure.
