You can select from 'Connections' where you wish to set up a query based on a Connection you have set up. You can also select 'Apps' which allows you to set up queries on other Apps you have stored data for or 'Lists' See [Data Lists Management](../../../../advanced-features/data-lists-management/index.htm)

In the screen shot below, we have selected 'Apps'.

The first screen you will see shows all the Apps that are available to you. The Apps are shown as the lowest level branches in the file structure. Within each App you will see that Application Craft has listed the available tables as the tree view nodes. You can select one or more tables from different Apps by either dragging from the Apps tree view and dropping in the right hand side or by using the buttons in the middle.

If you were selecting a Connection/List then you can do the same, although if you are selecting more than one table, they must all be from a Single Data Agent.

Once you have selected all tables you require, press Next.
