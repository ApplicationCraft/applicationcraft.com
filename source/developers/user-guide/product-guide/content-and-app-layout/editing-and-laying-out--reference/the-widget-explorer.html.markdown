A feature that you will need to use when working with relative layouts is the Widget Explorer. This is located on the left side of the page. At the bottom of the toolbox pane are four tabs that allow you to switch between the Widget Toolbox, Style, Code Â and Explorer panes.

The Explorer lets you locate your Page, Widgets and Containers easily.

When you click on a Widget in the Explorer, the Widget will be shown in the main area.
