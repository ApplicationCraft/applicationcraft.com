As an alternative to Drag Alignment, you can use the Snap to Grid features for precise placement of Widgets on the Page.

Each Page has its own Snap to Grid settings which are located in the Grid section of App Properties. You can enabled or disable the grid entirely by using the Snap to Grid property and you can also adjust the snap size with the Grid Size property.
