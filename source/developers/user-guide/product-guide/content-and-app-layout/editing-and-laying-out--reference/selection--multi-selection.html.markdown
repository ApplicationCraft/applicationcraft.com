Widgets are selected in the following usual ways

 - by clicking

 - holding down the Control key on a PC or Command key on a Mac, click on further objects to multi-select

 - rubber band selecting multiple widgets

## Tip: By holding the shift key down and rubber band selecting multiple objects, you will see that if you start the drag over a Widget, that Widget is not selected. This makes it very useful for drag selecting when there is a background image that you do not want to include in a multi select or if there are many objects in close proximity.
