Here are many tips and tricks which will make editing and laying out your Apps much more quickly and simply, relieving you of those all too familiar headaches caused by crude layout tools.

Multiple Widget Selection

When moving multiple Widgets, you can use CTRL + Click, or (cmd + click on Mac) to multi select many Widgets by clicking on them individually. You can also deselect individual Widgets from a multi selection using the same method.

Smooth, One Pixel-at-a-Time Dragging

When you want to position a Widget or group of Widgets without having Drag Alignment enabled, after clicking to reposition the Widgets, hold down the shift key, and Drag Alignment will be disabled. Releasing the shift key during the drag re-enables Drag Alignment.

Nudging

For pixel precise Widget placement, you can use the arrow keys to shift any Widget into place, pixel by pixel.

Drag Select Avoiding a Background Widget

If you want to carefully multi select Widgets that lie on top of other Widgets, containers, images etc., without selecting the background Widgets themselves, hold down the shift key when starting your drag. This will deselect all Widgets and groups under the point where you have clicked, and only contain Widgets inside the drag area.

Locking & Unlocking Widgets

You can use lock and unlock to keep items together when arranging, which is especially useful when working with multiple Widgets in close proximity. Locking a Widget fixes it in the same position, and unlocking it leaves it free to move again.
