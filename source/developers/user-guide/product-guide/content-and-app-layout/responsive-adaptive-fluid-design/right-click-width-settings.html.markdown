If you want to set the Min and Max Width properties of the Sizes property while you are adjusting a widget's width in the designer, then you can right click on the widget.

Adjust the width in the IDE until you have found a minimum or maximum and then right click. From the 'Sizes' option you can set or clear minimum and maximum width properties.
