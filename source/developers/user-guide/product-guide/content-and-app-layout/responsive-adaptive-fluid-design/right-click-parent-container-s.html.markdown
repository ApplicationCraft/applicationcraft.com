When laying out complex UI's you will often have nested Containers. In many cases a widget may fully occupy the area of its parent container, making that parent difficult to select.

You can switch to the Explorer tab in the left column, or you can use a special right click option.

In the above image, you can see a selected image widget. Having right-clicked it, you can see all of the ancestor containers, right up to the App itself.

 - videoContainer - the image's immediate parent

 - parentContainer - the image's grandparent

 - LearnMore - the page these are located on

 - qreative cards site - the app itself

Just select one of these and that object will be selected.
