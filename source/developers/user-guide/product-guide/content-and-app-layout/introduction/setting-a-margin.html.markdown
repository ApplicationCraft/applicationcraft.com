If you are working in Vertical or Horizontal layout modes, you will often want to set a margin to separate it from its neighbors. You will find the Margin property at the bottom of the property bar in the Style section.

You should note, though, that if you add a large left margin, this will push the widget potentially beyond the right edge of the widget's container (or page). To correct for this, you should reduce the % Width property.
