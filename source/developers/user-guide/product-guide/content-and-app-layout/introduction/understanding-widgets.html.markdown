When you design a Site or App UI, everything uses Widgets. Widgets are found in the Toolbox on the left side of the Designer. They are dragged into the Page either directly or into another 'container' type widget.

Once the Widget is in the page, you control its appearance and behavior by selecting and modifying its properties. The properties are listed in the property bar on the right side of the Designer.

Application Craft has a lot of Widgets, many of which are intended for App building rather than pure content, although you are free to use any of them.

Common Content Widgets

The following Widgets are the most commonly used and useful for typical Content Sites.
