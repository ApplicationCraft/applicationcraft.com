Styles can be set for all Pages and all Widgets in an App. Any changes you make to the Style settings will be saved in the Theme, and so will affect all Apps using that Theme.

The Styles are managed in the Styles section on the left side of the Design screen.

When you select a Widget in the designer, the available pre-set Styles for that Widget will be shown in the Style section. This will always include a Default setting. You can only create new Styles, edit Styles or delete Styles if you have permission to edit the Theme used by the App.

Page Styles

The Page Widget Style contains settings for the Page Size, Color and Shadow for that page. It also contains default Text Color and Text Font settings for all Widgets placed on the Page. Â The Text Color and Text Font settings will be applied to all new widgets placed on the Page.

Page Properties

The Properties contained in the selected Style are shown in light italic text in the Properties section.

To override the Page style settings, you can select a Widget and either select a Style for that Widget from within the Style section, or manually set the properties in the Properties bar.

New Pages will be given the default Page style automatically. You can change the Page default settings from any page in an App. This will change all pages in the App that use the default settings.

To change the default Page style, select the default style in the Style column on the left side of the designer, make any changes you want in the Properties column on the right side of the designer, then select Save in the Style column. All pages with the 'default' Page Style will now be changed to the new default settings.

Widget Styles

All Widgets have a default Style, and can have any number of other Styles associated with them.

When a new Widget is placed on a page, it will inherit the default Style settings for that Widget. Initially these will contain the Text Color and Text Font settings contained in the Page Style for that page. If the default settings for these two properties have been changed for a Widget, then this will override the Page Style settings.

The Page Style defaults can be restored to the Widget by selecting Reset in the Style section.

Changes made in the Properties bar will override the Widget settings contained in the Style section for the selected Widget only. This will not affect other Apps using the same Style or Theme, or other Widgets of the same type within the same App.

Changes made in the Style section will apply to all Widgets using that Style, and will override the Page style settings. These changes affect the Theme being used by the App and so affect all Apps using that Theme .

The buttons at the top of the Style section allow you to edit the Styles contained within a Theme in the following ways:
