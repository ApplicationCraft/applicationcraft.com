**Themes** contain a set of Styles for different Widget types (including Pages).

**Styles** contain a set of Properties for Widgets.

Styles contained within a Theme can only be changed if you have permission to Edit the Theme that you are using. Any changes you make to a Style are made to all Apps that use that Theme, not just the App that you are editing. Individual Widgets can have individual Style settings which override those of the Theme.

For detailed information on editing Themes and Styles, see the following sections:

[Theme Management](themes--styles/themesmanage)

[Style Management](themes--styles/style-management)
