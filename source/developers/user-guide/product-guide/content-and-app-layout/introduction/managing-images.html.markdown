In most cases, you will want to add images to your content. There are two principle ways of doing this

## Use the Image Widget

This allows you to place a dedicated image onto the page. Depending on the Layout mode of the page or container where you drop the widget, you can position to the nearest pixel (absolute mode) or relative to other widgets above, below or alongside it (vertical or horizontal modes). The image Widget can point to a URL or an [Application Craft Resource](../../the-console/console-tabs/resources) .

## Image within the Text Editor

If you are including an Image relative to or within a piece of text, you may be better of inserting a link to the Image within the label editor. You should first add a Label widget to the page and then select the HTML property in the property bar on the right hand side. This will bring up the rich text editor.

You can insert an image by pressing the Image icon within the rich editor. You can then point to an image url. If you have uploaded an image as an Application Craft Resource, then you can go to the [Resource tab](../../the-console/console-tabs/resources) in the Console and copy the url from there. We will soon be incorporating direct access to the Resource list from the rich text editor.
