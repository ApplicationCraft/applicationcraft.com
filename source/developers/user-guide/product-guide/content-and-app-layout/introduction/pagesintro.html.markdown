A Site/App can have as many Pages as you want. A Page will take its Style properties from the App Theme property. These properties can be overridden. Â See [Page Properties](../../widget-properties-events/page-properties) for more information on individual Page properties.

## Add New Page

The most comprehensive way to access your pages is at the bottom of the main layout area, where you can add pages, move from one to the next using the arrows or jump directly to a Page from the pop-up list.

## Changing the Page Order

The page order matters only as far as you use Page Jumps that refer to 'Next' or 'Previous' pages. Action Buttons can jump directly to any pages. It makes sense, though, to organize your pages logically and you can modify the page order by pressing the 'Page Order' button in the 'App' menu bar. You can move pages by dragging a page or by using the buttons.

## Deleting a Page

A Page is deleted by selecting its background and then pressing the Delete or Backspace keys.
