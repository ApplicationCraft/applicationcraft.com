The SSJ Database methods allow you to manage your own errors using standard javascript try and catch statements.

However, if you do not handle an error yourself, Application Craft will catch the error for you and will automatically throw and error and call your client side callback function.

Your catch() should throw() an error in order to trigger the correct type of callback.

## Example

Here we can see a simple function with error handling. e is the error object generated by Application Craft when it detects and error. You can pass this back or you can pass back your own message object. Up to you.

    var cObj = ssj.getConnection("abcdef12-efb9-431a-b137-87b4749f2473");
    cObj.beginTransaction();
    try {
             cObj.insert("customers", cust.data);
             cObj.insert("people", person.data);
             cObj.commit();
             return("ok");
    }
    catch(e) {
             cObj.rollback();
             return(e);
    }
