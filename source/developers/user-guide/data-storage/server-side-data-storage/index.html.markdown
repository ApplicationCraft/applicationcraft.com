Application Craft has a powerful set of functions and features that allow you to build applications that store data on a cloud database or any other database that can be accessed via a Connection.

The following topics should be understood in order to build these solutions

 - [Connections](../../product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/connections/index) - accessed through the AC Console, this allows you to access a connected database

 - [Server Side Javascript](../../scripting-apis/server-side-scripting-overview/index) - the features offered here allow you to build secure server side scripts that can receive and process data. Business logic, validations and database transactions are all catered for

 - [Session Variables](../../scripting-apis/server-side-api/ssj-object/security/setsessionobject) - a part of Server Side Javascripting, use of Session Variables allow you to secure your server side scripts fully

 - [Database Methods](../../scripting-apis/server-side-api/ssj-object/database/index) - also a part of Server Side Javascript, the database methods allow you to manage SQL operations such as Select, Insert, Update, Delete in a friendly way. You can also write literal SQL statements and call stored procedures.
