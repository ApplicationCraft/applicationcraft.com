## {string} getLatestError()

Return Value

Returns an error string.

Description

This retrieves the latest error generated by server side script execution for [httpRequest()](../web-service-calls/httprequest2.htm) , [httpRequestAdv()](../web-service-calls/httprequestadv.htm) , [getViewData()](../database/getviewdata2.htm) as well as many of the [sys object functions](../../sys-object/index.htm) . More functions may be added in the future that provide error data in this way.

The above mentioned functions may generate errors internally, but we don't want an exception to be thrown. Â These functions will return false in the event of an error. At this point, you can inspect the error using ssj.getLatestError().
