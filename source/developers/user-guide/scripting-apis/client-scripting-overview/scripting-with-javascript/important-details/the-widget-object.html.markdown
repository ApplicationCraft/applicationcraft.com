Whenever an AC Event is fired, you have access to the \_widget object variable within the event function. This object provides functions that give you access and control over most aspects of an AC Widget.

The [Widget Object](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/objects-titbits/widget-object) is described in more detail in the [Client API](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/) section.

For a good example, please refer to the [\_widget](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/objects-titbits/ref-widget) section in the API Function Reference.
