IMPORTANT

**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../../product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

An App Instance is a record of data. Please refer to the [Data Storage](../../../../product-guide/advanced-features/data-storage-management/) chapter for detailed information on this.

AC allows you to manage your App Instances using Javascript. The following functions are available

 - [instanceNew()](../../../client-api/instance-data-functions/instancenew)

 - [instanceCreate()](../../../client-api/instance-data-functions/instancecreate)

 - [instanceDelete()](../../../client-api/instance-data-functions/instancedelete)

 - [instanceUpdate()](../../../client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesave)

 - [instanceLoad()](../../../client-api/instance-data-functions/instanceload)

 - [instanceSync()](../../../client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesync)
