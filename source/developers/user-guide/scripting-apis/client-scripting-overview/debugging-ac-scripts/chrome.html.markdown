Google Chrome comes with Developer Tools support that many readers will already be familiar with. In order to debug an AC App, you need to have the debugger open. This is done as follows

Starting the Debugger

 - Mac - View menu, then select Developer Tools (cmd+shift+I) or Javascript Console (cmd+shift+J)

 - PC - Select the Chrome menu (the spanner/wrench symbol), then locate the Tools menu.  Now select Developer Tools (ctrl+shift+I) or Javascript Console (ctrl+shift+J)

In order to invoke the debugger, you should include the command 'debugger;' in your App code. As long as the Developers Tools window is running, it will then automatically stop at that statement.

The following sections in this user guide explain more about debugging you can refer to the following API support functions

 - [debugOutput()](../../client-api/app-functions/debugoutput)

 - [debugValues()](../../client-api/app-functions/debugvalues)

 - [debugData()](../../client-api/app-functions/debugdata)

 - [debugProperties()](../../client-api/app-functions/debugproperties)
