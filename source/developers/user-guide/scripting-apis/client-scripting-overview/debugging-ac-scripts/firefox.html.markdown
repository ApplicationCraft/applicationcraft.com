You should download and install the Firebug add-on for FireFox. Although we currently recommend Google Chrome as our preferred browser for building Apps, due to its better performance, FireFox is an excellent browser and Firebug a great debugger.

For those of you using Firebug, the approach is exactly the same as for Chrome. The only differences are the way that the debugger is accessed from the menu or hot keys.

Please refer to the [Chrome](chrome) section for more information.
