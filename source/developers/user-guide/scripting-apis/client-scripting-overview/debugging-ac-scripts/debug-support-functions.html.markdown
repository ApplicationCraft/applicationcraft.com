AC offers several support functions that help you debug your code.

 - [debugValues()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/app-functions/debugvalues) - allows you to watch one or more specified Widget Values

 - [debugData()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/app-functions/debugdata) - allows you to watch the contents of one or more specified Widgets

 - [debugProperties()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/app-functions/debugproperties) - allows you to watch the properties of one or more specified Widget Values

These all allow you to watch a single Javascript object with the individual widget contents represented as properties within the object.

These, combined with the ['debugger'](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-scripting-overview/debugging-ac-scripts/the-debugger-command) command are all you need to bolster the Chrome or Firebug debuggers.
