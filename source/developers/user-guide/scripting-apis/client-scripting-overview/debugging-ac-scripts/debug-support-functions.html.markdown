AC offers several support functions that help you debug your code.

 - [debugValues()](../../client-api/app-functions/debugvalues) - allows you to watch one or more specified Widget Values

 - [debugData()](../../client-api/app-functions/debugdata) - allows you to watch the contents of one or more specified Widgets

 - [debugProperties()](../../client-api/app-functions/debugproperties) - allows you to watch the properties of one or more specified Widget Values

These all allow you to watch a single Javascript object with the individual widget contents represented as properties within the object.

These, combined with the ['debugger'](the-debugger-command.htm) command are all you need to bolster the Chrome or Firebug debuggers.
