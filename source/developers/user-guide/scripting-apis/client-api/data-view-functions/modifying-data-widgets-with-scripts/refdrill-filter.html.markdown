You can modify a Widget's Drill Filter in two ways

 - Change the actual Drill Filter property as described in the previous [Filters](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/data-view-functions/modifying-data-widgets-with-scripts/filters) topic.

 - Use the [drillDownBroadcast()](/developers/user-guide/scripting-apis/client-api/data-view-functions/drilldownbroadcast) function to add your own filter expression to the View's dynamic drill filter.
