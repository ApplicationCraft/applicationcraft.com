## instanceNew ()

IMPORTANT

## WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](../../../data-storage/server-side-data-storage/index.htm)

## WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.

Description

This creates a brand new Instance within the currently loaded App. Note that only Widgets that are set to be stored in the database will actually be reset. All others will be left unchanged.

If you want to reset all fields in the App, then use app.reset().
