For anyone looking to get their first Site up and running as quickly as possible, start here:

## [![Videos\_P](/img/docs/videos_p.png)](http://www.applicationcraft.com/learning-center) Developer Center / Training Videos - probably the best place to start, this is a collection of short videos that will get you up and running as quickly as possible. [Go to Developer Center](http://www.applicationcraft.com/mobile-application/developer-center) .

## Preloaded Demo Content - We put a couple of Content Sites and Apps into your Account so can take a look at something that already exists. Check the 'Private Folder' in your account.

If you are building Mobile content, then read the [Content and App Layout](product-guide/content-and-app-layout/index.htm) chapter and within that, the [Mobile Specific](product-guide/mobile-apps-sites/index.htm) chapter.
