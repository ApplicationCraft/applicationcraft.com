This section covers what is necessary to generate the certificates and profiles necessary to allow you to develop and test your Apps using [AC Mobile Build](../../../../ac-mobile-build/index.htm) , [Phonegap:Build](../../../../phonegapbuild/index.htm) or [Phonegap/Cordova with XCode (Phonegap Direct)](../../../../phonegap-direct.htm) .

Please note that this section assumes that you have just created an individual account (not a company account) and that it is still in a virgin state.
