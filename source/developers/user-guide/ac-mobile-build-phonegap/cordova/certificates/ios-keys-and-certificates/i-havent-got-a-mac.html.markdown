iOS Assist is a Application Craft service, so whether you have a Mac or not, you simply get in touch with Application Craft Support (support@applicationcraft.com) and we will take care of all the tricky steps for you.

Whether you use iOS Assist or you do everything yourself, you will need to sign up for an [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com) . At the time of writing, this costs \$99 per year for an account.

## Our iOS Assist service offers the following

Certificate and Provisioning Profile Service for General Development

After you have created your developer account, you give us temporary access so we can create your P12 certificate and Mobile Provisioning Profile for development purposes. This will allow you to develop and test any number of Apps but you will not be able to deploy to the App Store.

Distribution Provisioning Profile

When an App is tested and ready to deploy to the App Store, you will need to generate a dedicated Mobile Provisioning Profile that is App specific.

Deployment to the App Store

You need a Mac to do this. You can prepare all the basic information about your App, including descriptions and screenshots, but the actual uploading of the binary requires a Mac with XCode installed. Our deployment service allows us to manage this process for you.
