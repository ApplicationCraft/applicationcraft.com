Unlike iOS, you can actually build and distribute your Android APK files without having to codesign your Apps. However, if you want to distribute your Apps via Google Play, you should

 - Codesign your Apps

 - Signup to Google Play

 - Upload your Apps to Google Play

This chapter describes how all this is done.
