Application Craft generates Web Apps. However, these can be turned into Native Apps that run as native Apps on iOS, Android, WebOS, Blackberry and Symbian with Bada, Windows.

These apps can access device hardware and features such as GPS, Accelerometer, Camera, Audio, Contacts etc and can also be deployed in App Stores.

Using our [AC Mobile Build](application-craft-build.htm) platform you can also integrate with a number of Plugins for iOS and Android.

This chapter describes the various ways you can generate and deploy these native Apps.
