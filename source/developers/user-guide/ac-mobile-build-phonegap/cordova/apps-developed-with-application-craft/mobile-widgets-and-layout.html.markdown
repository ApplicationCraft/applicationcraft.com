If you are building apps that are going to run on mobile devices or tablets, then make sure you have read the section on [Mobile Specific Layout](../../../product-guide/mobile-apps-sites/index.htm) . This gives ideas on how to build apps with adaptive layouts that work on phones, tablets and desktops from a single design. It also goes into detail on some of the more important mobile widgets.
