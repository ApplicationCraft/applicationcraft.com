In order for AC to be able to add the handler for your customer property, it simply needs to be loaded in one of the following ways

  1.   Add it to the Source tab in the Console for the Widget. Place the code along with the main code for the Widget it belongs to. If you have more than one widget with this custom property, then just add it to one of the widgets and make sure it is enabled.

  2.   Use the Load from URL option as described [here](/developers/user-guide/adding-widgets-and-api-methods/overview/phase-i-of-development) .
