This is one of the most powerful features for developers. If Application Craft does not have a certain Widget that your App needs, then you can build one and plug it into AC. The AC Framework allows you to configure the following elements

 - Toolbox section and icon

 - Properties

 - Standard and user defined property dialogs

 - Widget  events

 - Screen rendering of your Widget

 - Automated Data Storage

Application Craft Widgets are built in Javascript and they can be added to your Application Craft account via the Console. The steps for adding your own Javascript Widgets to the system are explained in [Adding a Native AC Widget](../../product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/more/widgets/adding-a-native-ac-widget) .

The following chapter explain all of the important steps in building your own Widget.
