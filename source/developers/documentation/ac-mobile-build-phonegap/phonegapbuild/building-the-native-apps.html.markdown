 - Press the Build/Rebuild button to start the build process. Application Craft will now call PhoneGap:Build in the background and the build will run asynchronously.

 - You can close the window now and open it later. The build process can take anywhere between 2 and 5 minutes depending on the server load. As soon as each platform native App is built, you will see it appear in the window.

 - The build is then deleted from your PhoneGap:Build account.

 - Any errors will be reported. In the event of errors you can Download your app and then log into your PhoneGap:Build account to build from the index.html file of your downloaded app. The app will not then be deleted on completion and any errors detected can be investigated.

 - iOS will not be available until you have registered an appropriate certificate and profile in your PhoneGap:Build account. See [https://build.phonegap.com/docs/ios-builds](https://build.phonegap.com/docs/ios-builds) for more information.
