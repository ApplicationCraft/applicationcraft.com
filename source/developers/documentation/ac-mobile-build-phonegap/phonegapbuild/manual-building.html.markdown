In some cases, you may want to build your Apps manually. The main reasons for doing this are

 - You want to specify a codesigning key other than the default for the iOS, Android and Blackberry App Stores

 - You want to use the Debug mode that PhoneGap:Build offers

Follow these steps

 - Click on the Download button. (the debug option is described in [Native Apps](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-scripting-overview/debugging-ac-scripts/native-apps) ).

 - Upload this file into PhoneGap:Build by selecting 'Apps' and then pressing the 'new app' button.

 - Select the option 'upload an archive or index.html file' and point to the ZIP file you downloaded.

 - PhoneGap will now build your Apps.
