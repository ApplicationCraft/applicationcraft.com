If your App is running as a Native App (these features are not accessible for apps running on devices as regular web apps) and you need access to device features, such as

 - GPS

 - Accelerometer

 - Camera

 - Compass

 - File System

 - Storage

 - Audio

 - Contacts

Then you need to access PhoneGap functions. The full documentation is available at [http://docs.phonegap.com/](http://docs.phonegap.com/)
