You can specify your own images for both the loading splash screen and the device icon. Both of these properties can be found in the general section of the App properties

 - Icon - the icon that will appear on the device screen. See [Icon Management](/developers/documentation/product-guide/mobile-apps-sites/icon-management)

 - Splash Image - splash screen displayed while the App is loading. See [Splash Image Management](/developers/documentation/product-guide/mobile-apps-sites/splash-image-management)
