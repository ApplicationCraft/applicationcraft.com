Once you have built your App using either [AC Mobile Build](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/cordova/ac-mobile-build/) or [Phonegap:Build](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/cordova/phonegapbuild/) , you are ready to publish it to the App Store. Deploying it for testing purposes is described here and does not involve the App Store.
