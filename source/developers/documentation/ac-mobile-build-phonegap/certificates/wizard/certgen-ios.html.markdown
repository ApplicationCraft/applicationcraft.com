##Create your Apple Developer Account
You need to do this first before you go any further. Please refer to the [Apple Accounts](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/do-it-yourself-guide/apple-accounts) section for details on how to do this.

##Ready to go ...
With your uploaded App selected, as shown below, you will see a button labelled 'Create P12'. You should press this to get going.

In the first screen, you should enter the fields as shown. Be sure to note your password or you will need to restart the entire process. Press Next when you are done. At this point, a 'Certificate Signing Request' file will be generated.

##Step 2

On the above screen, you should carefully follow the steps listed.

You should press the 'Request Certificate' button. Ignore the download part but this is where you upload (item 3.) your Certificate Signing Request' file. You then follow the steps within the Apple Developer Portal until you see the following screen.

At this point, you can download the Certificate by pressing the 'Download' button and finally upload the CER file into Application Craft. 

##Step 3 - Nearly Finished
You are now done, and the Certificate will have been added to the drop-down list of Certificates in the main Console screen.

##Have you created your Mobile Provisioning Profile?
In case you thought you were done, you need to Add a Device, Create an App ID and a Mobile Provisioning Profile. This is all done in the Apple Developer Portal as described in [this page](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/do-it-yourself-guide/setting-up-for-development/add-devices) and the 2 pages after it.
