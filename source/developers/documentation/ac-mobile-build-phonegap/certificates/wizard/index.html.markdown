The Application Craft platform includes a Certificate Generator wizard that avoids you having to install or use tools that you can manage without. 

You should select your App in the AC Mobile Build tab within the Console as shown below.

The process is different for iOS and Android so if you are building for both platforms, you will need to do each one separately.
