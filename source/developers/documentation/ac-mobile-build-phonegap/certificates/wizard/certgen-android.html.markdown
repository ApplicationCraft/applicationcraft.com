You do not actually need to even create a Certifcate for Android. You can use the default debug certificate. However, if you want to deploy to Google Play, you will need to generate one.

##Ready to go ...
With your uploaded App selected, as shown below, you will see a button labelled 'Create'. You should press this to get going.
