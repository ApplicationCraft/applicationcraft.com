You should codesign your APK files if you want to distribute them properly via App Stores such as Google Play. To do this, you first need to generate a Private Key.

If you would like assistance generating your keys, please contact [support@applicationcraft.com](mailto:support@applicationcraft.com) . We offer a service - [iOS Assist](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/i-havent-got-a-mac) - that is designed to take away the pain from this process. Luckily, compared to iOS, Android is somewhat less of a challenge and so you will need a lot less assistance, if any. The only part of the process which is a little painful is the key generation described in this section.

## Obtain a suitable private key

In preparation for signing your application, you must first ensure that you have a suitable private key with which to sign. A suitable private key is one that:

 - Is in your possession.

 - Represents the personal, corporate, or organizational entity to be identified with the application.

 - Has a validity period that exceeds the expected lifespan of the application or application suite. A validity period of more than 25 years is recommended.

 - If you plan to publish your application(s) on Google Play, note that a validity period ending after 22 October 2033 is a requirement. You can not upload an application if it is signed with a key whose validity expires before that date.

 - Is not the debug key generated by the Android SDK tools.

 - The key may be self-signed.

If you do not have a suitable key, you must generate one.

There are a number of ways this can be done for Android, one is by using Keytool.

The Keytool utility is available in the Java Development Kit (JDK) available to download here: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

To generate a self-signed key with Keytool, use the keytool command and pass any of the options listed below (and any others, as needed).

Here's an example of a Keytool command that generates a private key:

    $ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   

Running the example command above, Keytool prompts you to provide passwords for the keystore (Certificate password) and key (File password).

 - It then generates the keystore as a file called my-release-key.keystore.

 - The keystore and key are protected by the passwords you entered.

 - The alias is a name that you will use when adding your certificate file to [AC Mobile Build](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/) .

For more information see here: [http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html) .

Save the keystore file in a location you can remember. Remember the password: you will need to enter it to [AC Mobile Build](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/) , otherwise we cannot use your certificate.

**To Add your Android Certificate File**

 - Open the AC Mobile Build window in console.

 - Select the “Upload” in the Android section.

 - Enter required fields.

When have entered the required certificate file, press the Build/Rebuild button to start the build process. Application Craft will now call the build service in the background and the build will run asynchronously.
