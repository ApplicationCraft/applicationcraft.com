The first step is to visit the Google Play Android Developer Console and register for a publisher account.

 - Visit the Google Play Android Developer Console at [https://play.google.com/apps/publish/](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) .

 - Enter basic information about your developer identity — developer name, email address, and so on. You can modify this information later.

 - Read and accept the Developer Distribution Agreement that applies to your country or region. Note that apps and store listings that you publish on Google Play must comply with the Developer Program Policies and US export law.

 - Pay a $25 USD registration fee using Google Checkout. If you don't have a Google Checkout account, you can quickly set one up during the process.

 - When your registration is verified, you’ll be notified at the email address you specified during registration.

 - If you will sell apps, set up a [Google Checkout Merchant Account](http://checkout.google.com/sell) .

 - Explore the [Google Play Android Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) and learn about the tools for publishing.
