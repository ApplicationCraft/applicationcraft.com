These are the key requirements and features

 - You must be a company with a DUNS Number.

 - The Apps you build should only be used by your company's employees.

 - Apps do not get reviewed.

 - Apps are not submitted to the App Store, but can be installed from a company server or distributed as a file.

 - All company devices will need to be registered.
