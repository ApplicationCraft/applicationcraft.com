Please follow these steps to get set up with your Apple Developer Account. If you feel that you qualify for the [iOS Enterprise Program](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/do-it-yourself-guide/apple-accounts/creating-an-apple-enterprise-a) or [iOS University](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/do-it-yourself-guide/apple-accounts/ios-university-program) Program, check these out before signing up as described below.

Note that Apple may update their site, so if you see any image discrepancies, let us know and we will update this guide.

If you have not already got an Apple ID, get one by Registering and/or logging in.

Once you are logged in with your Apple ID you will see (on the right) an option to Join the iOS Developer Program. Click the header (not the Learn more option) and you will then be taken to a screen where you are asked to enroll.

Now you should enroll. This process requires you to fill out several screens of information.

Follow the process through and answer the questions as you go. They are all fairly straightforward. One thing you will need to decide, and it is worth getting this right first time, is the decide whether to enroll as a company or an individual. If you enroll as an individual then you are creating something like a single user account. However, if you want other developers to be able to work independently or to co-administer the portal, then you should create a Company account. This takes longer to set up but better do it right now than try to change later on, which is painful.

You will then be asked to select a program. Select the iOS Developer Program.

Continue through the remaining screens. Once you have paid, you will receive an email from which you can activate your account.
