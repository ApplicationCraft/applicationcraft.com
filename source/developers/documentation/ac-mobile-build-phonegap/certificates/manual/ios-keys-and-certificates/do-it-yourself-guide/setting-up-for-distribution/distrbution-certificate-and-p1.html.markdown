You will need to create a special Distribution Certificate. This is tied to you, the developer, and you need only one for all your Distributed Apps. Please refer to the [Create Development Certificate](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/do-it-yourself-guide/setting-up-for-development/certificates) section but be sure to select the Distribution tab and not the Development tab at the top before following the steps.

Once you have done this, make sure you refer to the section [Generate a new P12 Certificate](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/do-it-yourself-guide/setting-up-for-development/generating-a-p12-certificate) . Again, be sure to select the Distribution tab and not the Development tab at the top before following the steps.
