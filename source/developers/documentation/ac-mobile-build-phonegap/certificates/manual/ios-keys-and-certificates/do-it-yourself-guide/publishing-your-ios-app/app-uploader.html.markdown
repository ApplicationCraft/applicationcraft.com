The final step before submitting the App is to upload the actual .ipa file to iTunesConnect. This cannot be done via the browser and requires a Mac running the Application Loader application.

If you don't have a Mac, then don't worry, we can do this for you as a part of our [iOS Assist service](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/ios-keys-and-certificates/i-havent-got-a-mac) .

If you do have a Mac, then you can download the Application Loader application from the Manage your Apps section of iTunesConnect : [https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=manageApps](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=manageApps)

You will find the link to download the Application Loader application near the bottom of the page.

If it is already installed (as a part of XCode typically) then you can find this in your Finder under Developer\>Applications\>Utilities.

You will need to identify yourself with your Apple ID initially. This can be changed by clicking on the user button at the top, where you  should already see your Apple ID displayed.
