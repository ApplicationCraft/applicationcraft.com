The final step before submitting the App is to upload the actual .ipa file to iTunesConnect. This cannot be done via the browser and requires a Mac running the Application Loader application.

If you don't have a Mac, then don't worry, we can do this for you as a part of our [iOS Assist service](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/i-havent-got-a-mac) .

If you do have a Mac, then you can download the Application Loader application from the Manage your Apps section of iTunesConnect : [https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=manageApps](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=manageApps)

You will find the link to download the Application Loader application near the bottom of the page.

If it is already installed (as a part of XCode typically) then you can find this in your Finder under Developer\>Applications\>Utilities.

You will need to identify yourself with your Apple ID initially. This can be changed by clicking on the user button at the top, where you Â should already see your Apple ID displayed.
