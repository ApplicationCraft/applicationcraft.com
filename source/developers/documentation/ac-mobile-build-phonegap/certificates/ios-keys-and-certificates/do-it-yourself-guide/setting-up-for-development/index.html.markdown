This section covers what is necessary to generate the certificates and profiles necessary to allow you to develop and test your Apps using [AC Mobile Build](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/) , [Phonegap:Build](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/phonegapbuild/) or [Phonegap/Cordova with XCode (Phonegap Direct)](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/phonegap-direct) .

Please note that this section assumes that you have just created an individual account (not a company account) and that it is still in a virgin state.
