If you want to compile your App with AC Mobile build and it was developed with Application Craft (if you built your App externally, [click here](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/external-html5cssjs-apps) ), then you select your App in the usual Apps tab in the Console.

As you can see from the screen above, you then press the Mobile Build button. You should then select 'AC Mobile Build' and you will be taken to the main screen where you can control the build process and manage your certificates.
