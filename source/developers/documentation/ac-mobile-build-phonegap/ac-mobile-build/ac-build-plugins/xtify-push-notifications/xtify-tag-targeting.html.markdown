Another powerful feature of Xtify is the ability to send notifications to users who have certain tags. 

As a simple way of explaining this, let's say that your App has a settings screen where you collec the Sex and Age of the user. You might then want to add tags "MALE" and "YOUNG" to the Xtify system. 

You can then send notifications on a manual or automated basis to users of a certain App with specific tags.

You can find documentation about the [Xtify Tag API here](http://developer.xtify.com/display/APIs/Tag+API+2.0+%28Latest%29).

You call this API using [app.httpRequest](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/soap-restful-ajax-calls/httprequest/).

You set up the Targeting rules in Xtify in the same place as for [Geo targeted notifications](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/xtify-geo-targeting/).
