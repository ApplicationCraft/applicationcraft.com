##IGNORE CONTENT UNTIL UPDATED FOR ANDROID

This is actually a good time to check that you can build your App properly. If there are any issues at this point, it is best to isolate them here and now before we do the Push Certificate generation.

The process of creating certificates and building your App is [described here](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/). For Android this is quite straightforward and for development testing you can build your app using the included Debug Certificate.


##Success?
Once you can build and deploy your App to your device, you are ready for the final bit.
