To be able to push notifications to Android devices you need to set up Google Cloud Messaging to obtain your Sender ID and API Key.

To get started go: [http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/gs.html](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/gs.html) .

## To Create your project

As you create your project, your browser URL will change to something like:

[https://code.google.com/apis/console/\#project:4815162342](https://code.google.com/apis/console/#project:4815162342)

Take note of the value after \#project: (4815162342 in this example). This is your project ID, and it will be used later on as the GCM Sender ID.

## To obtain an API key

In the main Google APIs Console page, select API Access.
