The general approach is to try and debug on your dekstop as much as possible. This means you avoid compile processes and app startup etc., so you can debug much faster.

However, there comes a point when you will need to test your App compiled with AC Mobile Build on your mobile device.

This is a [must read item](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/apps-developed-with-application-craft/acmb-debugging/) for anyone wanting to not waste huge amounts of time recompiling, installing and running for each code change you make.
