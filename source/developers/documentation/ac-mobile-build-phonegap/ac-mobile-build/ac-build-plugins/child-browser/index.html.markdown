The Child Browser plugin allows you to display external web pages within your app, in a sub view. It is preferable to a regular link in that it allows the user to press a button to dismiss that view, returning control back to your App.

## HTML5+CSS+JS Apps not developed in Application Craft

If you have developed your App outside Application Craft then please do the following

 - In your index.html include childbrowser.js

 - In your config.xml add \<gap:plugin name="ChildBrowser" version="x.y.z" /\>

You should replace x.y.z in version='x.y.z' depending on which version of Cordova you are using for your App. Please refer to the list below

 - Cordova 1.6.0-1.8.0 use "2.1.0"

 - Cordova 1.9.0-2.0.0 use "3.0.0"

 - Cordova \>=2.1.0 use "4.0.0"
