Once the Apps are built for each platform, you will see the following screen:

![acbuild\_post](/img/docs/acbuild_post.zoom81.png)

You can now run these on your mobile device in one of two ways:

 - Scan the QR-Code on your mobile device.

 - Download the App binary by clicking on the download link beneath each QR-Code.

Once downloaded, you can copy the binary to your device.

If you are using iOS, you can open iTunes and in the Library section on the left, locate Apps.

You can drag your App into the main App area.

You can also double click the downloaded ipa file and that can also add it into your iTunes.

When you sync, the App will be transferred to your iOS device.

Important: this will not work unless your device has been added to the iOS Provisioning Portal. Please refer to [Add Devices](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/certificates/manual/ios-keys-and-certificates/do-it-yourself-guide/setting-up-for-development/add-devices) for more information.
