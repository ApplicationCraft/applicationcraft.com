You will initially see a relatively short error description. We are striving to make this error clear and helpful. Most errors are related to bad certificates or provisioning profiles and the messages shown should make this clear and point to a remedy. See [Build Error Messages](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/build-error-messages)

If the short description is not helpful, then you may want to take a look at the full error details, although this is not for the faint-hearted. Â Click on the 'more info' link to see it.
