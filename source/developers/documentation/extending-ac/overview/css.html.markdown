If your widget needs to reference any external CSS then the best way (for the time being) to handle this is to reference an external CSS url from your javascript code.

You can place your CSS file on your own server or, once production ready, you can upload the CSS into the AC Resource section of the Console and reference that.

From approximately August 2012 we will be adding built in CSS management that will be simple and allow integrated editing.
