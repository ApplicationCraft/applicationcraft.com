Log in to the AC Console and locate the More tab. A drop down will appear and you will see a 'Widgets' entry.

Create a new widget and give it a name. You should also check the enabled box and specify which Toolbox section it should appear in. You can also specify the url of an icon. You can upload your icon as a resource within AC and reference that.

**Note** : Icons should be 64 x 64 pixels
