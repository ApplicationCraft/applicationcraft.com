When developing a new Widget, the best way to do this currently is to work in 2 phases.

Phase I - For the time being, you should develop using your regular javascript development tools and upload to a url that AC can access. Before too long, we will provide a much better way to do this completely within the AC IDE, so please view this as a temporary solution.

Phase II - Once your widget is tested and running, you can upload all your code into AC.
