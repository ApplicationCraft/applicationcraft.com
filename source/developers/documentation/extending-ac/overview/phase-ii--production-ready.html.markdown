Once you are happy that you widget is ready for production, you should put all of your widget and, if you have some, dialog code into a single code block and then paste this into the Source area within the AC Console.

You should also change the widget type dropdown to 'AC Native Widgets'.

This process will ensure that all code is loaded in an optimal way for AC.
