In order to build Application Craft Widgets, we are assuming the following

 - Javascript : you should have intermediate skills to easily understand the widget structure; if you want to build the most complex widget types, then more advanced skills are suggested

 - JQuery : Application Craft uses JQuery for managing the HTML DOM, Events and Selectors. It is not a requirement to understand JQuery and we abstract the developer from this. However, having a solid JQuery knowledge will allow you to understand the inner workings of the Framework. Application Craft Widgets are not based on JQuery (so nor do yours need to be) but we still use JQuery internally.
