Application Craft has a number of dialogs that you may wish to use from your own custom dialogs. The topics within this chapter have been added by popular demand. If you see another AC dialog that you wish access to, please email [support@applicationcraft.com](mailto:support@applicationcraft.com) and we will add it quickly.
