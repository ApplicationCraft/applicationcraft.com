Many of Application Craft's widgets (but not widgets that are only available in paid subscriptions) are available on GitHub. If you would like to see how we implement certain things then this is the best way of learning.

Our GitHub repository is located here : [https://github.com/ApplicationCraft](https://github.com/ApplicationCraft)

If you wish to make modifications then you are free to do so. You can also submit Pull Requests.

It is possible that not all widgets are available. If you identify a particular widget that is not there and is available in the Free subscription, then please email support@applicationcraft.com and tell us which one. We will do our best to add it quickly.
