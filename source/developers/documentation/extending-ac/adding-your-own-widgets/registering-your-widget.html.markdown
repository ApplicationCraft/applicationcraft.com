Once you have built your own widget, you will need to register it within your Account on the system. This is done through the Console as described in the [Widgets](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/more/widgets/) section of the Console documentation.

Once registered, this widget will be available to all developers in your Application Craft account.
