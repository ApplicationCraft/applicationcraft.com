This section deals with extending the Application Craft system with Widgets and API Extensions for scripting. This section is aimed at developers who need to integrate, customize or extend Application Craft rather than build Apps with AC. This section is aimed at competent to advanced Javascript developers.

If you are looking for information on how to write scripts within your Application Craft Apps, please go to the [Scripting & APIs](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/) section in the User Guide.
