Your server side scripts are also written in Javascript. Much like client side scripts, they are event driven through a special set of server side events. You can also write your own server side methods that can be called from your client side script.

The main reason for writing server side scripts is to execute certain processes more securely than on the client. You should consider all client scripts inherently unsecure as they can easily be tampered with. By executing a script on the server, it is not possible for anyone to tamper with that script before executing it.

The most common usage of SSJ is to write your database layer. Application Craft has a set of database handling functions that make database handling extremely easy and powerful. Please refer to the section [Database Handling with SSJ](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-scripting-overview/database-handling-with-ssj) for more information.
