Server Side Javascript can be considered a part of your Client Side App when it comes to editing the code. You load up your App and switch to Code Mode. On the left hand side you will see a folder labeled 'Server'. This is where you find and edit your SSJ scripts.

You can create a variety of private and public scripts as described in the [SSJ Methods](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-scripting-overview/ssj-user-defined-methods) topic.
