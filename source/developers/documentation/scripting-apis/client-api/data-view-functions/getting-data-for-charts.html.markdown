You may want to use getViewData() to get data from Application Craft Data Views that should then be manipulated and used to populate single and multi series charts.

You will find some good example in the [Populating Charts from Script](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-scripting-overview/populating-charts-from-script) section.
