## Description

This function allows you to define callback functions that should be called whenever

 - data is about to be fetched (preCallback)

 - data has been fetched (postCallback - this is the one you will use most often)

## Callback Functions

The callback functions have the format **callback** (error, data, identifier), where Â error is a boolean value and data is an array containing the returned data and identifier is the string specified in the bindViewData() function call.

The identifier is the identifier string that was included in the bindViewData() function call. It allows you to uniquely identify a binding should multiple viewBindData calls all share the same callback function.
