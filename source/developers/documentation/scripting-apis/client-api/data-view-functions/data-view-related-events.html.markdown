## Example

    function handler_rptTest_onRowLoaded(index, createdRow){
        calc = createdRow.w('lblA').value().toUpperCase();
        app.setValue(createdRow.w('lblCalc'), calc);
    }
    
   

The above example shows a row of a repeater being loaded and the event being called. `createdRow` is the object of the row added. `calc = createdRow.w('lblA').value().toUpperCase();` is looking for the Widget called '` lblA`' and converting it to an upper case string. The next function sets the widget called '`lblCalc`' to be that new string.
