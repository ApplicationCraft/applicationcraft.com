**deleteRowById** (Id)

## Parameters

<table>
<tr>
<td width="116">
{string} Id

</td>
<td width="14">
</td>
<td width="750">
the string Id of the Grid row to be deleted

</td>
</tr>
</table>
## Description

This is a function of the widget object, so it is used as objWidget.deleteRow() rather than app.deleteRow(). It removes the row with the specified Id from a Grid Widget. This will only be needed in rare circumstances and you are more likely to use deleteRow().

Populating Grids with Id values is [described here](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-scripting-overview/scripting-with-javascript/widget-reading-writing/widget-content-reading-and-writing/widgetcontentgrids-repeater-containers) .
