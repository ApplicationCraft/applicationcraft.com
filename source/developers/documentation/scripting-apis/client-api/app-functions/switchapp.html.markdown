## twirlyThing Object

You can control the hourglass appearance using the following object

	{state:true,
	 text:"text",
	 textColor:"000000",
	 bgColor:"ffffff,
	 opacity:100
	}

## inputParams Object

This object is used to pass parameters in the same way as you would pass them in the querystring.

	{someParam1: "someValue", 
     someParam2: 123
     someParamN: paramN
    }

## Description - Simple Switch

This function is used to switch from the current App to the APP specified by the appID string. You only supply a single parameter.

 `app.switchApp('7eb99414-8584-4fbe-a9ba-3fa8d3f50df6');`

## Description - Detailed Switch

If you want to specify not just the App to switch to but also the Page within that App that should be displayed and/or the App Instance that should be loaded, then you should supply the following object.

 `app.switchApp({appId: "6ec70b3b-4cdb-468d-b0bc-0e6230aa771c", pageName: "my page", formInstance:'7eb99414-8584-4fbe-a9ba-3fa8d3f50df6'});`

You must always specify the appId but can then specify either the pageName or the formInstance or both.

## Parameter Passing

There are two ways to pass parameters between Apps.

 - [Global Data Pool](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/global-data-pool-functions/) - This allows data to be passed between Apps as well as restoring data when you eventually switch back to the App that was switched away from.

 - switchApp() parameters - this may be preferable in some circumstances where you are not going to modify the values and inspect them later (in which case the Global Data Pool is better).

## Important

If you are using switchApp() in Mobile Native apps, you must define the 'child' apps as Linked Apps. See [App Properties](/developers/documentation/product-guide/widget-properties-events/app-properties)
