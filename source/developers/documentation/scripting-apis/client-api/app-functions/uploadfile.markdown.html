##Description
This method is used to return a url for a local file in a Native app as an AC resource. 

Behaves like upload button widget(s) but does not require user interaction. For example, this method can be used to work with file attachments in [sendEmail](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/ssj-object/miscellaneous/sendemail2), [MailTo Plugin](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/mailto-plugin/) and working with [DropBox](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/dropbox-object/) methods in Native Apps.


##Example
	url = app.uploadFile(localPath, function(error, res){
		console.log('error: ' + error + ' res: ' + res );
	});
