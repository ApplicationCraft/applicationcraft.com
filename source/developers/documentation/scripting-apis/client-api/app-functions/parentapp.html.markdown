**parentApp** ();

## Description

This function is used in association with Embedded Apps and allows the Embedded App to get the App object of its parent (the App it is Embedded in).

## Example

A typical example would be to include an App as a cross-app menu bar. It can be Embedded into all your individual Apps that together form one, large Application. When the user clicks on a link, the Parent App must be used to switch Apps using the app.switchApp() function.

    function handler_lblFindPeople_onClick(mouseev){
        app.parentApp().switchApp("ffb343ba-0550-4af3-ad0d-954fd068b68e");    
    }
