These functions allow values and entire instances to be saved outside the scope of an individual App. This is especially useful when switching between Apps with [switchApp()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/app-functions/switchapp) or as a way of passing data between Apps running within the same browser session.

## In This Section

 - [setGlobalData()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/global-data-pool-functions/setglobaldata)
    Save any data to a variable that exists independent of all Apps
 - [getGlobalData()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/global-data-pool-functions/getglobaldata)
    Gets data into a variable that was previously saved with setGlobalData()
 - [clearGlobalData()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/global-data-pool-functions/clearglobaldata)
