Whenever an event is called, the Widget Object (or page object as a page is also considered a Widget within AC) is available through the \_widget variable. The \_widget object can also be passed as a parameter to most Widget functions instead of a string.

The \_widget object provides access to many [Widget Functions](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-functions/) .
