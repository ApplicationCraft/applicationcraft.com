Application Craft is based on JQuery. As a result, it is possible to create effects for Widgets. For a detailed description of JQuery effects, we recommend referring to the [JQuery effects documentation](http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/) .

This guide offers some basic examples that show you how to access these effects from within your Apps. The following are typical effects

<table>
<tr>
<td width="196">
  <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/fading/">fadeIn()</a>

</td>
<td width="18">
</td>
<td width="666">
Fades a Widget into sight. Use fadeOut(0) first.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="196">

</td>
<td width="18">

<td width="666">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td width="666">

## Examples

Fade a Widget out instantly and then fade it back in over 2 seconds

    app.w('shape1').base().fadeOut(0);    
    app.w('shape1').base().fadeIn(2000);

Move a Widget from its current position to a new position 500 pixels to the right and 100 pixels lower down. At the same time, change its opacity Â and height. All done over a 3 second period.

    app.w('textarea1').base().animate({
            opacity: 0.25,
            top: '+=100',
            left: '+=500',
            height: 400
    }, 3000);
