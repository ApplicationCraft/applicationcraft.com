**connectionObject.exec** (strSqlString)

## Parameters

<table>
<tr>
<td width="181">
{string} strSqlString

</td>
<td width="18">
</td>
<td width="681">
the Connection ID of the Connection as found in the AC Console

</td>
</tr>
</table>
## Returns

The result set from the SQL execution as an array, where each array element corresponds to a single item in the result set.

## Description

This is used in the following common scenarios

 - executing SELECT statements that were prepared with the cObj.select() method (refer to the [Select Handling](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/ssj-object/database/select-handling/) section for an overview of how AC handles SELECT statements)

 - creating your own SQL Statement that you want to pass directly through to the database for execution

 - calling stored procedures

## Example Select Statement Execution

    cObj = ssj.getConnection("abcdef12-efb9-431a-b137-87b4749f2473");
    selectObj = cObj.select().from("customers").where("id=?", p.id);
    cObj.exec(selectObj);
     
    selectObj = cObj.select().from("customers").order("companyName");
    cObj.exec(selectObj);

## Example Stored Procedure Call

Below is a very simple MySQL stored procedure definition that returns the total number of customers.

    CREATE PROCEDURE sp_numCustomers()
    BEGIN
      SELECT count(*) from customers;
    END

The following code would call this stored procedure from an SSJ script

    cObj = ssj.getConnection("abcdef12-efb9-431a-b137-87b4749f2473");
    return(cObj.exec("CALL sp_numCustomers()"));
