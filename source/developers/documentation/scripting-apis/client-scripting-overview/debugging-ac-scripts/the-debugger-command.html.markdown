You should include the 'debugger;' command within your Javascript code so the debugger automatically stops at this point within your code.

        watchVar = app.debugValues(["firstName", "Email", "Listbox"]);
        debugger;
      
   

Note how the watchVar = app.debugValues(["firstName", "Email", "Listbox"]) is placed on the line beforehand. This will create a variable called watchVar that you can immediately watch (it is automatically placed within the local scope variables in Chrome) to see how specific Widget values are set at that point.
