If you want to store your data in a Server Side Database, then there are some special functions that help you extract data from Widgets into a Javascript object very efficiently.

Please refer to the [Widget Data & State Manipulation](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-data-state-manipulation/) section for information about these functions as well as the [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/) chapter.
