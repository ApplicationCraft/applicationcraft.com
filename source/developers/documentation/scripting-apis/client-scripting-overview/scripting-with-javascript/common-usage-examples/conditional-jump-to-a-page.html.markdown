This is one of the most common scripting uses. When a button is pressed, you need to jump to a page depending on the answer to a question in your App.

    function handler_btnNext_onClick(mouseev){
        //Write code handler here
        if(app.getValue("rbFemale")) {
            app.pageJump("FemalePage");
        }
        else {
            app.pageJump("MalePage");
        }
    }
   

In this example, we are inspecting the contents of a RadioBtn named rbFemale using the getData function.
