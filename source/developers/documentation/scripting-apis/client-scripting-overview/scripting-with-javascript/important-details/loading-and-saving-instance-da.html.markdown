IMPORTANT

**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS  FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

An App Instance is a record of data. Please refer to the [Data Storage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-storage-management/) chapter for detailed information on this.

AC allows you to manage your App Instances using Javascript. The following functions are available

 - [instanceNew()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancenew)
 - [instanceCreate()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancecreate)
 - [instanceDelete()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancedelete)
 - [instanceUpdate()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesave)
 - [instanceLoad()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instanceload)
 - [instanceSync()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesync)
