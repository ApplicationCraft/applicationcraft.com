Developers are able to extend the Application Craft API so that functions and Web Services can be accessed in the friendliest manner possible. If you regularly access a complex Web Service, for example, a developer can instead simplify that Web Service and add any supported calls by extending the app DOM object. Once this has been done, AC Builders can then access it with the normal app.myService.myMethod() approach.

Whilst this makes life very easy, it requires that a developer carries out the extension by extending AC with some PHP work. This is properly documented in the [Extending AC](/developers/documentation/extending-ac/) section.
