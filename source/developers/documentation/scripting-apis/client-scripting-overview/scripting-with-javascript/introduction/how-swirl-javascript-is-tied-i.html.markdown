Javascript functions are invoked through Events. The following App events are available

 - App Events - something happening with the App itself such as the App opening, submitting data, shutting down

 - Page Events - the App is already up and running and the Respondent is moving between pages

 - Widget Events - this is the most common place to write scripts

Having identified the Event you wish to write a script for, click in the right column and select 'Javascript' from the drop down list. Automatically, AC will change to 'Code Mode' so you are able start writing your script.
