You may also access browser objects directly from your scripts.

The following example uses the window object to open a new browser window of a specified size.

    window.open("http://www.dynamicdrive.com", "", "width=800px, height=600px, resizable")
    
The following example uses the math object to generate a random integer between 0 and 10)

    Math.floor(Math.random()*10)
   



Take a look at the Javascript Kit site to find out more about available objects.
