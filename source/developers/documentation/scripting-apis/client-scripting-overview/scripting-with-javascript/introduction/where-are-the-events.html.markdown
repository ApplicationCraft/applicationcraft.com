Events are available for the App, Pages and Widgets. Select one of these and then, at the bottom of the property bar on the right side of the screen, you will see two tabs labeled 'Events' and 'Properties'. Click on the Events tab and you will see all available Events.

Select 'Javascript' from the available list

Each event can reference the object [\_widget](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/objects-titbits/ref-widget) . This is the [object of the Widget](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-scripting-overview/scripting-with-javascript/important-details/the-widget-object) that the Event belongs to.
