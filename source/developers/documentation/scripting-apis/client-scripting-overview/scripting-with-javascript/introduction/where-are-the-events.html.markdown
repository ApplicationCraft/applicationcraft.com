Each event can reference the object [\_widget](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/objects-titbits/ref-widget) . This is the [object of the Widget](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-scripting-overview/scripting-with-javascript/important-details/the-widget-object) that the Event belongs to.
