Now let's change a widget property or two. You will find yourself doing a lot of this once you get going.

##Changing the text on the button

1. Double-click the button you created on your page. 
1. You will see that the default propert is automatically selected, so simply type in 'Greet Me!'.
1. Press Enter or Tab and you will see 'Greet Me' appears on your button.

##Changing a color
Let's start of with the color of the text on the button.

1. Click on the button you added to your page.
1. Locate the 'Style' section in the property bar.
1. Click on the Color property. A color dialog will appear, so select a color for the text label within the button and press OK.

You can change other properties in this way.

##Changing the Label text
Let's finish off by double clicking the Label widget. The Label property will be automatically selected, so enter something like 'Enter your name ...'

You may need to resize the width of the widget, so select it and grab the right edge and drag it to fit the way you want it.

##Changing the 'Placeholder' property of the Text field
Another thing you could do is to select the Text widget and then look for the Placeholder property. Try 'First and Last Name'. You will see that this now appears as a greyed out text instruction within the widget.

##How does it look now?
You should see something like this on your page ...
