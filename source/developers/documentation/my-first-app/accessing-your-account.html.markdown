There are a couple of ways to access your account.

## URL in your browser
You can always access your Application Craft account by entering the following into your browser's address bar

 - yourdomain.applicationcraft.com, where yourdomain is the name you chose when signing up.


## Chrome Web Store
If you are using the Google Chrome browser, then this is an excellent way of getting into your account with a single button press.

 - [Click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/application-craft/fnbfgfpielckjhdohmkacklnnjkdpkdc?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon), then click on the 'Add to Chrome' button.
 - Alternatively, you can search manually for Application Craft in the Chrome Web Store and add it that way.

Once you have added Application Craft, whenever you open a new browser tab, you will see the AC icon which you can click on to take to directly into your account.

## Logging In
Once you access your account, you will see the login screen. You can then login, or if you clicked the 'Remember me' checkbox, you won't even have to login.
