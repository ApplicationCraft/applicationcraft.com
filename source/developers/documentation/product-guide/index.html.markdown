For anyone looking to get their first Site up and running as quickly as possible, start here:

![Videos](/img/docs/videos_p.png) Watch the [Training Videos](/developers/training-videos), a collection of short videos that will get you up and running as quickly as possible.

**Preloaded Demo Content** - We put a couple of Content Sites and Apps into your Account so can take a look at something that already exists. Check the 'Private Folder' in your account.

If you are building Mobile content, then read the [Content and App Layout](/developers/documentation/product-guide/content-and-app-layout/) chapter and within that, the [Mobile Specific](/developers/documentation/product-guide/mobile-apps-sites/) chapter.
