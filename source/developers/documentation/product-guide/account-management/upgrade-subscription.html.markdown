A check will be made to confirm the user account has the necessary privileges before any existing account information will be made available and any changes can be made.

If you are already a subscribed user and are adding/removing a user you will be shown the new total cost and this will then be reflected in your future payments.

For more information on changing your subscription, see our Pricing FAQ's [here](/product/pricing)
