To cancel your account subscription, hover over your user name to select Cancel Subscription.

![CancelSub](/img/docs/cancelsub.png)

A check will be made to confirm the user account has the necessary privileges before allowing any changes to be made.

**Please note:** Developers do not need to be deleted entirely. You can disable developer users so their work/apps are not deleted but just not available and another developer can be registered to work within your account

More information on cancelling your subscription is available [here](/legal/faqs/#Cancel)
