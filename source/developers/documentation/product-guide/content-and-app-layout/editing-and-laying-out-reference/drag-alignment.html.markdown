Getting Widgets to lineup properly can be a real headache. Application Craft offers Snap to Grid but also a more automated approach called Drag Alignment.

The best way to explain this is for you to try it out. Just try to recreate the field layout you see below.

  1.   Drag a Label onto a Page and drop it as the "First Name" field.

  2.   Now drag the next Label and drop it where the "Last Name" field should go. Having dropped it, click and drag it to get the positioning right. As you move underneath the Widget above, notice how the guides appear. If there are multiple Widgets above, it will show guides for each of them as it approaches the horizontally matching position .

  3.   Do the same for "Age".

  4.   Now drag in the Text and Numeric fields and you can see how you get slightly different behavior when laying out an object next to another object . Notice how you get a position guide - this can be especially useful when lining up field labels and text fields or labels.

To turn off Drag Alignment when positioning your Widgets, hold down the shift key whilst moving the selected Widget(s) and drag alignment will be disabled whilst the shift key is held down.
