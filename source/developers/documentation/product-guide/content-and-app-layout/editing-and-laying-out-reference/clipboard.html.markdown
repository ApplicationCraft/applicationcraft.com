Cut, Copy and Paste is fully supported within the same App. If you wish to copy and paste Widgets between different browser windows or tabs, then this has support but only via the menu options at the top of the page or via the right-click menu. Hot keys will not work between different browser windows.

The usual hot keys are also supported on PC and Macs
