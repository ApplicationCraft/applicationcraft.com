In order to control whether Widgets appear in front of or behind other Widgets, each Widget is assigned a Z-Index property in the Layout property section.

To adjust the Z-Index, you should select a Widget and then right-click to bring up the context menu. From here, locate the Arrange option and you can move the Widgets layer.

A higher Z-Index property indicates that the Widget will appear in the foreground relative to one with a lower Z-Index.
