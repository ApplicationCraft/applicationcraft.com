You can create your own menus and navigation strategies using any of the Widgets available to you. The most likely Widgets are Labels, Images and occasionally Buttons.

## Page Property

Use this if you specified "Page" in the Action property.

## Repeat Property

In most cases, you will want to use this feature with the Repeat property set. This will ensure that you only have to build a menu on one Page and it will then appear on any specified (or all) Pages automatically.
