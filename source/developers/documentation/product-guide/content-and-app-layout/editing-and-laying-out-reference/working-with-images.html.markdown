Almost every App will have images displayed in its Pages to make forms look good.

## Resources

Application Craft handles Images in a very elegant fashion. Rather than loading your images into the App directly, AC requires you to load your image as a Resource. Resources are managed in the Console and are described in detail in the [Resources](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/resources) section.

Images can also be uploaded directly from the Image widget dialog.

The big advantage of this is that Resources can be shared and re-used by other Applications. If you like, you can place images in the Public folder of the Resources manager so that anyone in the organization can use them.

You can apply permissions to all Resources if you need to restrict access.

## Image Widget

Having loaded your image Resources, you now locate the Image Widget in the Toolbox and then drag it into the Page. Now locate the Image property in the General section of the Property Pane. Click in the field and you can now locate your image in the Resource Browser dialog.
