Tab Order allows you to control how a user pressing the Tab key will proceed through the App you are creating. The list can be changed by going through Apps along the top bar, and then either using the up and down arrows, or by drag and drop. This is especially useful for form data as it allows the user to progress logically through the form, in a way you can control.
