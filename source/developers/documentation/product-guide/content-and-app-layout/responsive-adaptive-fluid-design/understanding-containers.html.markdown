A container is a widget that contains other Widgets. The most widely used container is the page itself. When you create a new App, you will find a page ready and waiting to be used.

However, there are also special Container Widgets. These can be found in the Containers section of the Toolbox on the left side of the designer.

In the Mobile Widgets section you will also find the Toolbar and the Collapsible widgets both of which are (or have) containers.

The Table container is the most advanced of these as each cell within the table is a container in its own right.

There is not really any magic to a container or a container widget but the next sections are really important as they will ensure you can get nice device and device orientation independent displays.

## Nesting Containers

You can quite happily drop one container widget within another one. This is know as 'nesting'. More complex designs are often achieved by nesting one container within another.

## Showing Container Outlines

If you use nested containers, you may find it useful to show the container outlines clearly. To do this, you press the 'Outlines' button in the 'App' section of the top toolbar in the designer.
