When you have a widget inside a Vertical or Horizontal container and the widget's Percentage Width property is set to less than 100% you will often want that widget to be displayed centered within its parent container.

The 'Align in Container' property (Layout section) is responsible for this.

Note that if you have a text widget, the Text Align property (centers the text within the text widget itself) is different to Align in Container (centers the widget within its parent) and you may want to set both the be centered.
