Google Adsense allows you to display Advertising Content within your Map. In order for this to work, you first need to have set up an account with Google. This you can do [here](http://www.google.com/adsense).

Once you have signed up, you will get a Publisher ID from Google. This can then be pasted into the Publisher ID property of your Map. You can also set up Channels that allow you to better control your advertising. You can output Channel Numbers into the equivalent property.

You can control the location and style of the ads as well. The image below is an extract of the Map's Adsense property section

These properties can also be changed at runtime using the [app.setProperty()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-functions/setproperty) function.
