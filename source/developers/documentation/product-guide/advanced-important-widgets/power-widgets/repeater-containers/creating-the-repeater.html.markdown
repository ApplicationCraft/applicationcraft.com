The Repeater can be found in the Containers section of the Toolbox. When you drag this into the page, you will find there are two containers created

 - Outer Container - this is the maximum display area for all records

 - Inner Container - this is the container where you place the widgets that display a record of data. You can resize this to accommodate all widgets however you want to lay them out.

It is helpful to press the Outline button in the upper toolbar when working with Containers. This clearly shows the structure of each Container.

## Properties

To set Repeater Container properties, you need to be sure that the Outer Container is selected. The properties are listed in detail [here](/developers/documentation/product-guide/widget-properties-events/containers/repeater) . The following sections touch on the most important properties you will use.
