There are two ways you can control the Play, Stop, Pause, Volume etc.

 - With the Widget's in-built video controls

 - From Javascript (you would use other widgets, such as buttons, to control the video)

The Show Controls property allows you to specify this at design time.

The [Methods](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/video-audio-widgets/property-methods-event-summary/vidmethods) chapter below explains the various API methods available to help you control your Video from javascript.
