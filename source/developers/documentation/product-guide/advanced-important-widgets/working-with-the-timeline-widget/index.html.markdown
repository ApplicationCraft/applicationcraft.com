The Timeline Widget is a very powerful way of displaying time based events graphically.

![tl-sample](/img/docs/tl-sample.png)

The Timeline widget is ideal for displaying time based events. Each entry within the Timeline has to have a timestamp component that can be used to position it within the overall timeline.

You can also group events together and display the groups in a Tree section on the left side of the timeline widget. You can also create hierarchies within this tree.
