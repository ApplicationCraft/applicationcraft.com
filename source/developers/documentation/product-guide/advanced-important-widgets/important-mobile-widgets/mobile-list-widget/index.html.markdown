The Mobile List Widget is a very powerful and versatile widget. It can be used to display records of data. It is also an excellent navigation widget. In fact, the Mobile List widget has some great uses in desktop applications.

If you are building hybrid Mobile and Desktop Apps or content, then this really is a widget to use. The only caveat is that although it works in IE 6, 7 and 8 it is not a joy to behold. Where you see rounded corners and subtle gradients in other browsers, you will see square boxes with about the same color as otherwise but without any gradient effect.

## Mobile List Properties

Here are several interesting style properties

 - Show Image - includes and image in the list (80\*80px)
 - Image as Thumbnail - shows the image as a small thumbnail (16\*16px)
 - Show Count Field - displays a number in a count bubble on the right of the list item
 - Inset - insets the list and rounds the corners
 - HTML Label - The Label property contains formatted HTML.
 - Show Filter - include a filter bar at the top of the list
 - Numbered List - Number the list
 - Wrap - if set to true, then the content will wrap within the list element rather than being truncated.
 - Read Only List - no arrows on the right of the list
 - Show Aside - includes small text to the right
 - Mobile Theme - the color theme to use for the body of the widget
 - Divider Theme - the color theme to use for the dividers
 - Count Theme - the color theme to use for the count bubble
