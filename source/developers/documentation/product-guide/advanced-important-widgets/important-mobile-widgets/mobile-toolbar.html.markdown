The Mobile Toolbar is a container type widget that has explicit mobile device support. It has various uses and properties including

 - 'Fixed' property in the Style section that allows the bar to be fixed at the bottom or top of the screen

 - It has Mobile Theming that allows it to fit visually with other mobile widgets

 - Is ideal as a container for Mobile Action buttons (which automatically are rendered small when dropped into the toolbar)

 - The common container for the Mobile Navigation Bar that appears at the top or bottom of pages of mobile and desktop apps.

Although it is a mobile widget, it is just as useful on the desktop especially when used with the 'Fixed' property.

In the above image, you will see that when you drag a Mobile Action Button widget into the Toolbar, it is automatically drawn smaller than if it is elsewhere on the page.
