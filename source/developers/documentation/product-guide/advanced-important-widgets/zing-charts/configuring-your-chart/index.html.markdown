The first thing you should do is to drag a Zingchart widget onto your App. You can then configure your chart

 - either using the [Full Settings wizard dialog](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/zing-charts/configuring-your-chart/full-settings-wizard-dialog)

 - or from Javascript using the [fullSettings()](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/zing-charts/configuring-your-chart/fullsettings-javascript-method) javascript method from your own code

In both of these cases, you can configure both the full set of chart properties as well as the actual data for the chart. However, the Full Settings property is of limited value as your data is hard-coded with random or manually set data as you specified it within the wizard, so you should use refer to the section [Adding Data from Javascript](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/zing-charts/adding-data-from-javascript2) to see how you can override the data only.

Using the [fullSettings](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/zing-charts/configuring-your-chart/fullsettings-javascript-method) () method you can create properties and data dynamically form your code, so this is more powerful.
