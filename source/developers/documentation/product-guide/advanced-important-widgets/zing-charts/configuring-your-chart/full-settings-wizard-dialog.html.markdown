When you select this property, a wizard dialog will appear that lets you configure your chart settings At this stage, we do not have exhaustive documentation to cover all aspects of this dialog but it should be fairly intuitive. If you find that this does not give you enough control then try the Handcrafted approach described below.

The settings wizard generates a javascript object that is used internally. You can see this in the bottom section of the right hand pane. You can also edit the object by pressing the Edit button.

Due to the very extensive range of settings, it is possible that there may be some things that do not work as expected. In this situation, it is best to move to the Handcrafted Javascript approach.
