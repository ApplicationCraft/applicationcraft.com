COMING SOON

Once you have written your database handlers, you may want to expose these as Web Services to other systems or applications. This feature allows you to write standard DB handling code that can be used by any other system by simply calling a standard RESTful Web Service.

This is a very powerful feature and means you AC application code does not need to be duplicated in any way and your data can be easily shared amongst all of your Cloud or Enterprise systems.
