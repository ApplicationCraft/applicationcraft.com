The following example demonstrates a simple App that handles the following standard database operations

 - Select

 - Insert

 - Update

 - Delete

The only thing that this example does not show that you may want to add, is transaction handling. For those who need this, the ssj.,startTransaction, ssj.commit() and ssj.rollback() methods are self-explanatory.
