A Connection allows you to access an individual part of the data domain you are trying to access. It accesses a data source via the Integration Agent and is part of the process of getting data between the source and your App.

For example you might set up several different connections, each of which addresses one individual database visible to an Integration Agent.

Connections can also have permissions applied to restrict access. As you will see, Connections are used by [Queries](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/queries/) and also [Database Handling with SSJ](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-scripting-overview/database-handling-with-ssj)
