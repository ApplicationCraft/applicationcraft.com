User and Group management allows you to add control access to all important Application Craft Objects, such as Apps, Resources, Connections, Queries.

For Enterprise users, we have an LDAP Import capability that allows you to use your own Active Directory or other Directory Service as the source for Users and Groups. You will be able to perform manual and/or scheduled updates to your AC Users and Groups and support simple and advanced directory setups.

We will soon be introducing a Single Sign On capability that allows authentication to be handled on your own servers so your Users do not have to log into AC if they are already authenticated in your Domain.
