Anyone who accesses the Application Craft Console will require a User ID. You can also configure Apps to require someone to be authenticated before they can access an App Instance. Alternatively, users can access App Instances anonymously. Please see [Sharing](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/sharing) for more details.

There are 2 types of users:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="149">
 Developer

</td>
<td width="19">
</td>
<td width="667">
  This refers to the number of developer users in your account and can be granted <a href="/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/more/users-groups/users#rights">rights</a> to be able to access specific areas in your account.

Additional developer users can also be added to your account at any time by Upgrading your account. See <a href="/developers/documentation/product-guide/account-management/upgrade-subscription">Upgrade Subscriptions</a>

If you wish to reduce (temporarily) the number of developers in your account, but may want to upgrade again in future (or allow a developer to return to work in your account), you can disable developer users so their work/apps are not deleted but just not available.

<td width="667">
    This refers to any user accounts created in your account where you require <a href="/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/authentication-for-your-apps/">Authentication for Your Apps</a> or if using Server Side scripting <a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/sys-object/user-management/">User Management</a> . This user does not require any 'rights'. You can disable users to restrict access to your apps. Â There are no limits to the number of app users you can have in your account
