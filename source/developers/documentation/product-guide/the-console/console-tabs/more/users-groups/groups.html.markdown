Groups can be defined and Users then assigned to them.

![Groups\_screen](/img/docs/groups_screen.zoom46.png)

Operation of this screen is nearly identical to the [Users](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/more/users-groups/users) screen, so please refer to that section for details.
