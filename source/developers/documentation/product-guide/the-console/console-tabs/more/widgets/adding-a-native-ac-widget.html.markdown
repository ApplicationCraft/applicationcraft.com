The procedure for adding a Native Application Craft Â widget is almost the same as described in the previous section, [Adding a 3rd Party Widget](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/more/widgets/adding-a-3rd-party-widget) .

The main difference is that you need to tell the system that this is an Application Craft Native widget. To do this, you select Native Widget from the Type dropdown. When you paste your code into the Source tab, you will paste in your widget javascript code as described in [Adding your own Widgets to Application Craft.](/developers/documentation/extending-ac/adding-your-own-widgets/)
