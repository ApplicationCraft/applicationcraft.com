Google Analytics Parameters is where you enter your Google Analytics account ID. This code will be used on all Apps within your account, although you can also define other account ID's in any other App to override this account ID.

See: [Google Analytics](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/google-analytics/)
