\*\* System Parameters are coming soon. Contact us for information about availability \*\*

System Parameters are used by AC to centrally store and manage any information that may be subject to change over time, or you simply want to be able to centrally manage and administer. This could be the equivalent of a system wide Config file for those who like to think in developer terms.

For example, you might want to store the URL of a support site. If this changes, you want to be able to update it once, centrally, and then have all Apps be able to automatically reflect this new URL.
