Press Home in the Console window and then select 'Account Variables' in the Administer column. Now, on the left side of the screen, make sure you see the User Parameter Group list in the left side of the screen. Press 'New' to add a new Group and enter a group Identifier Name.

You have now created a new Group and you can now create Parameters within that Group.
