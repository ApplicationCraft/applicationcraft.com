Themes allow you to set the properties for all Widgets in an App using a pre-determined set of values, allowing you to easily change the look and feel of an App. Like Resources, Themes are stored centrally in AC.

## Themes Repository

All Themes are stored in the standard Private/Shared/Public folder structure as [described here](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/private-shared-and-public-fol) in more detail.

## Adding a Theme

When you add a new Theme by clicking on the New Object icon beneath the tree view, you are asked to enter a name for the new Theme.

All new Themes will initially have the default Theme settings.

## Editing a Theme

Themes are edited within the App Designer. Â See [Theme Management](/developers/documentation/product-guide/content-and-app-layout/introduction/themes-styles/themesmanage) for a detailed description of how Themes are edited and managed within AC.

##Importing/Exporting Themes

You can also import/export themes between AC accounts. Be aware though that if you import a theme that already exists and you select the 'rewrite' option this can effect all other apps in your account that are using this Theme.
