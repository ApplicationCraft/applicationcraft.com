To Import into your account, select the Import option from the appropriate tab

![Import1](/img/docs/import1.png)

and navigate to the export file. eg app\_myApp\_r2.acft

If the export was created to include 'dependencies' you will see these items included in the list of items.

If any of these dependencies already exist in your account you will be given options:

![Import2](/img/docs/import2.zoom87.png)

<table>
<tr>
<td width="182">
  <strong>Apps</strong>

</td>
<td width="8">
</td>
<td width="752">
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="182">
Rewrite/New

</td>
<td width="8">
</td>
<td width="752">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="182">
  <strong>Other Dependencies</strong>

</td>
<td width="8">
</td>
<td width="752">
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="182">
Rewrite/Clone/Leave

</td>
<td width="8">
</td>
<td width="752">
Rewrite to overwrite the existing theme. Clone to create a new theme, Leave to not import this theme

**NB if you overwrite the existing theme any other apps that use this theme name can be effected.**

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="182">

</td>
<td width="8">
</td>
<td width="752">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

If the export was not created to include 'dependencies' but the item already exists you will be given similar option to either rewrite the existing item or create as a new item

When importing Themes be aware that if you select the rewrite option, any other apps that use this theme name can be effected.
