Before you start, you will need to register your AC Application with the oAuth supported service. Once you have done this, you will end up with two important keys

 - App Key

 - App Secret

These need to be entered within your App properties as shown in the screenshot above. To get these keys, you will need to register your App with the service provider (Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox).

The following sections explain how to register your App with the service provider
