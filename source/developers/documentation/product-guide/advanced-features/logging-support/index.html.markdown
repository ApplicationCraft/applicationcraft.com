Logging is a feature that lets you write data to logs that are stored in the main database. You can use these logs for any purpose you like such as debugging or auditing system access. Log data is associated with an App.

App logs are then accessible as a regular Data View so you can add log reporting into your App as with any other Data View.

The log file is a single table in the database. It is accessed by Queries but users with the appropriate permissions can access a query that accesses all logs at once.
