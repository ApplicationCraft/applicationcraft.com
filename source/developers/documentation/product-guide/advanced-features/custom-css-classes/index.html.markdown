The Custom CSS Classes property can be used to customise your widgets using your own CSS file.

You can upload your CSS file to your account [Resources](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/resources) (select type 'other'), and then define the URL of this resource in the [App Properties](/developers/documentation/product-guide/widget-properties-events/app-properties) Preload Files property to ensure that the library is fully loaded before the app starts. Â Please note that this code will not be available in Preview mode
