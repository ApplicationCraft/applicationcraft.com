**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

If you are building anything beyond a Mashups or UI Front-End, you will want to store data for your Apps. We call a record of data associated with an App an 'App Instance'.

Application Craft provides really powerful data storage management without you ever having to define a table or index. You can even build Relational Apps.

Please refer to the chapters [Data Storage Management](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-storage-management/) for a comprehensive overview.
