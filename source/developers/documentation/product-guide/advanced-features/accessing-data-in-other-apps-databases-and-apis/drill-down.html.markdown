A further property of Views is the ability for AC to handle drill down events. If several Widgets all point to the same View, then you can tell Widgets to trigger drill -downs when interacted with (clicked on Chart, selected list item etc.). Widgets can also be told to listen to drill-down events triggered by other Widgets.

This is especially powerful for reporting and dashboard applications.

For a full understanding of drill-down please refer to the [Drill Down](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-integration-reporting-dashboards/drilling-down) topic as well as the [Data Section Properties](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-integration-reporting-dashboards/data-section-properties/) .
