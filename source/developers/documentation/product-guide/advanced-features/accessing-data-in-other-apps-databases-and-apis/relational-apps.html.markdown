**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS  FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

AC lets you define an App's relationship to other Apps. This allows AC to automatically set relationships between  App Instances. Please refer to the [Instance Relationships in Detail](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-storage-management/instance-relationships-in-detail/) chapter to get more detailed information on this.
