Grids, Repeater Containers and Data Containers should be well understood by anyone wanting to master AC. They allow external data to be really well presented through the UI and tie in very well with the Data Views and Queries.

The [Power Widgets chapter](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/power-widgets/) introduces these in more detail.
