Once you have defined your View, you can map Widgets to your data View. Each Widget has a 'Data' property section. This lets you tell AC which View a Widget should get its data from. There are some really powerful Widgets available such as the Grid, Repeater Container and the Data Container. These all make life easy when it comes to managing data efficiently.

Data Properties are described in detail in [this topic](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-integration-reporting-dashboards/data-section-properties/) within the Reporting and Dashboards chapter.
