If you want to send notifications to your native apps, the Xtify Push Notifications Plugin enables you to do this.

We have produced easy-to-use APIs that make accessing the Xtify APIs much easier than doing so unassisted.

 - [**Location API**](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/apis/xtify-location-api/) - this is also used from within your mobile App and it passes the user's current device coordinates to the Xtify system. You can then use the Notification API or the Xtify Console to target users who are at or near certain locations.
 - [**Tag API**](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/apis/xtify-tag-api/) - this API should be used from within your mobile App. It allows you to tag individual App instances with keywords. You can then use the Notification API or the Xtify Console to target users who have or do not have certain tags.
 - [**Notification API**](/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/apis/xtify-notification-api/) - this lets you send out notifications from an AC App and allows you to build tailored messaging Apps rather than using the Xtify Console. If you need to link with databases or other systems to assist targeted messaging, this is a big plus.
