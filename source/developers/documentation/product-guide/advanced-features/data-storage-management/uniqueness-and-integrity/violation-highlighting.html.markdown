**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

If the Integrity handling property is set to highlight offending Widget(s), then you can specify the color properties to use for the highlighting

 - Highlight color

 - Highlight opacity

These properties are also used by [checkMandatory()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-functions/checkmandatory) and [highlightWidgets()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/widget-functions/highlightwidgets) functions if their optional parameters are omitted.
