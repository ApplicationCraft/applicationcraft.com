IMPORTANT

**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

One useful feature is the ability to set up Grids or Repeater Containers to list Instances from any App so fields can be edited and rows can be added or deleted.

The [instanceSync()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/instance-data-functions/instancesync) function provides a simple function call that synchronizes Grids or Repeater Container Widgets with the underlying Instances.
