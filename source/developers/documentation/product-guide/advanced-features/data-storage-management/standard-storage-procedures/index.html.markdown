IMPORTANT

**WE ARE DISCONTINUING FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS Â FOR NATIVE DATA STORAGE. INSTEAD, WE HAVE INTRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DATA STORAGE USING ANY CONNECTED DATABASE. See: [Server Side Data Storage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/data-storage/server-side-data-storage/)**

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS. FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING RETAINED FOR A WHILE IN ORDER NOT TO DISRUPT EXISTING APPLICATIONS.**

This chapter describes how you set up your App to store data. For more advanced relational Apps, read the [Instance Relationships In Detail](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-storage-management/instance-relationships-in-detail/) and [CRUD in Detail](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-storage-management/crud-in-detail/) chapters.
