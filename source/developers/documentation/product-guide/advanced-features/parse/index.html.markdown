##Just Added!!!
The Parse.com support and documentation is added as of January 2nd, 2013. As such, you should be tolerant of documentation glitches

**PLEASE** : email fmay at applicationcraft dot com any comments relating to Parse.com so we can get rid of this notice asap.

Parse.com is a 3rd party service that allows developers to build certain server side features that are required by many web applications.

For anyone looking to address remote data storage for their Apps, we strongly recommend you look at implementing this using Parse.com's NoSQL solution (known as Objects within Parse.com). 

This will allow you real flexibility and ease-of-use. For mobile applications, you can also combine Parse.com (for remote storage) with [LocalStorage](/developers/documentation/product-guide/data-storage/mobile-client-side-data-storage/local-storage-example/) (local, offline storage) as both can easily use JSON data structures.

- A NoSQL database, known in Parse as **objects**. We have written some really nice [helper functions](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/parse/objects/parse-object-helper-overview/) that make this even easier to use.
- Push Notifications - currently, this is of limited use to the Application Craft developer as we have not yet created a Phonegap Plugin for Parse.com Push Notifications. Once we do, we will add full helper support.
- User management - Parse.com allows you to manage App users and so is often very relevant for Application Craft users. Until we implement our own helpers, you can [access Parse.com directly without helpers](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/parse/parse-direct-calls/). 
- User Roles - for those wanting to manage User Roles within their applications. Until we implement our own helpers, you can [access Parse.com directly without helpers](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/parse/parse-direct-calls/). 
- Installations: this allows you to manage individual user instances of your application. Until we implement our own helpers, you can [access Parse.com directly without helpers](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/parse/parse-direct-calls/).
