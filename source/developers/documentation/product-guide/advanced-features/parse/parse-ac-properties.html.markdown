Once you have created an App in Parse.com, you will need to transfer certain keys to Application Craft. You enter these as App properties, as shown below, but these are never loaded into the client of a running AC App, so your keys remain secure.

To find your keys, go to the Parse.com dashboard and click on the Overview button. You will; need to have created a Parse.com App first, which should be selected.

Now go the the Application Craft properties. You are able to add your Application ID and the REST API key into Application Craft.
