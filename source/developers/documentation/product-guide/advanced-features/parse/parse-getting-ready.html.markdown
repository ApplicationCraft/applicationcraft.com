The first thing you should do is to go to Parse.com and create an account. Once you are signed up, you are ready to create your first App in Parse.com. 

You can access and manage your Apss from the Parse.com dashboard.

##Documentation
Application Craft's implementation of Parse.com is simply a way of making the calls easier than making direct calls to the Parse.com REST API. The [documentation can be found here](https://parse.com/docs/rest).

Accessing Parse.com without Application Craft's helper functions can always be done. In fact, if you want to access Parse.com functions that we have not added helpers for, then you will have to access the REST API directly using ssj.httpRequest() calls as described in the next chapter.
