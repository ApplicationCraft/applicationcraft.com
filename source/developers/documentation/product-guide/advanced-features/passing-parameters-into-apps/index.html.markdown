You may want to call an App and pass in parameters to App Widgets. This can be accomplished by

 - Passing in data as a part of the URL (query string method)

 - Passing in data parameters through Javascript and embedded Apps

You then use the [getInputParameters()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/app-functions/getinputparameter) function within AC Javascript to map these to Widget fields.

You should also refer to User Parameter Groups as a powerful way of managing additional, application specific user parameters.
