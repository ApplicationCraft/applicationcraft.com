Language Tokens are AC internal 'variable' names that AC uses to identify each string associated with a Widget. However, your Multi Language applications will usually have messages that you want to display to the user from within your javascript code.

The Token management allows you to easily manage all types of strings. Take a look at the following screenshot and you can see that we have 3 languages supported by our App. By default, only the original language will have any text in it, which is the text entered through the IDE as you designed your App.

You are free to translate this string table both automatically and manually. A common approach is to translate your App automatically first (as described in the following section) and then manually go through the translations correcting errors as you find them. You can also export as a CSV file to work with externally and import in subsequently
