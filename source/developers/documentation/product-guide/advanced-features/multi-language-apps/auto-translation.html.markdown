Auto Translation is a feature whereby Application Craft will attempt to translate each empty field in all languages using the Google Translate API. It will only attempt to carry out a translation where the destination language field is empty.

You will need to carefully check the translated fields after the automatic translation has taken place and then manually overwrite the fields as required.
