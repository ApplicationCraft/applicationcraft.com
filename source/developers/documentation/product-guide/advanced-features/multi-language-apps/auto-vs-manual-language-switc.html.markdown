The decision whether to use automated detection is use-case specific. However, in the majority of cases, the automated language switching will probably be preferred. This is achieved by checking the "Try to get from browser" box in the [Languages](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/multi-language-apps/setting-for-auto-language-dete) dialog.

If, however, you want to control the process manually, then you can incorporate this into your Javascript logic and use the app.language() function to switch to another language.
