A Workflow diagram is a visual representation of your process. Currently, it performs no purpose other than to

 - define your process visually and help you keep an overview

 - define Stages

It does not drive or assist in any logic definitions, which must be done in Javascript.

Open up your App and then, on the bottom of the screen next to the Designer and Code buttons, you will find the Workflow button.
