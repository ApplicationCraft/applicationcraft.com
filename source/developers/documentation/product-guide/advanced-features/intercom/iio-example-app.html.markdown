We have prepared a very simple example App that can be downloaded [here](/apps/app_Intercom.acft). This is not a comprehensive App at all, but it shows a few basics and is a good way to play around with Intercom with little effort.

You will need to change the App Id and App Key values in the Server Side code to match your own. This was described in the previous section.

Also, you will not be able to use Intercom.io's messaging features without a paid subscription.
