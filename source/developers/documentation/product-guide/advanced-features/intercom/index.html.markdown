Once you have built your App, what about engaging with your App users properly? There is a great product, that we ourselves use within Application Craft, called [Intercom.io](http://intercom.io). Intercom is great for measuring user activity and stimulating engagement.

The Intercom.io dashboard is shown below

And if you click on a user, you can see the user data

Messaging, a paid feature of Intercom.io, is very powerful feature.

Intercom.io gives you the following key features

- a real-time dashboard that lets you monitor who is using your App along with any extra user data you choose to add.
- the ability to segment your users on any data you associate with your users
- a manual or fully automated messaging system so you can communicate with your users via email or by an inbox you build into your App

At a basic level, you can monitor user activity, so things like

- Who is signed up to your App?
- Who is signed in to your App?
- When did they last log in?
- How many times have they logged in?

You can also add custom data that is specific to you App such as

- What plan are they on?
- What type of customer are they?
- and any other fields of data that are important.

When you are then interacting with your Intercom Dashboard, you can then segment your users based on any of the fields you use.
