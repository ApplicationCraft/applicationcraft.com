This will download the app source code to your PC within a zip file. Extract the contents of this zip and copy/move them to the required location on your own webserver. Â Reference the index.html file to access the app.

Please note that due to security limitations, the App [uploadFile()](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/client-api/app-functions/uploadfile/) function or the following widgets cannot be used in apps deployed to your own servers: Common [Upload Button](/developers/documentation/product-guide/widget-properties-events/common/upload-button2/), Mobile [Upload Button](/developers/documentation/product-guide/widget-properties-events/mobile/upload-button) and Advanced [File Upload](/developers/documentation/product-guide/widget-properties-events/advanced/file-upload/)

If deploying to an IIS webserver you may need to configure the server to allow the return of \*.json files. It is not enabled by default.
