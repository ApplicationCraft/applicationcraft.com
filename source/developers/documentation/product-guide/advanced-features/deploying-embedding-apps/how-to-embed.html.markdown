Embedding is really simple. You locate your App in the Console and then, on the right hand pane, hover over the 'More' button and then select the 'Embed' button. You will see a window appear which display the HTML code the you should include in your web page. It looks something like this

    <script src="http://ac-dev.applicationcraft.com/embed/2d0ca47f-93sd-4ca9-b268-9c8a7fg22b0f.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
   
If you wish to pass data into your embedded apps, you can adapt the embedding code to use the `waInitform()` function. See [here](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/passing-parameters-into-apps/passing-in-data-with-embedded/) for more information.
