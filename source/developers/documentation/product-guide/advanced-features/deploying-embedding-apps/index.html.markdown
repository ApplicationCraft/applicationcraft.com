There are three main ways that you can deploy an App:

 - Embedded - this allows you to embed an App within your own HTML web or portal page

 - Browser - the App is displayed in its own browser window

 - Deploy your app to your own webserver

Apps can appear in either or both formats depending on its launch context. For example, you might initiate a new Instance of an expense claim App within a corporate web page, but after that, the approvals process is handled by emails and an approver would be shown the App Instance in a fresh browser window having clicked on the Notification Email.
