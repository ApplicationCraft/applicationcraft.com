To configure your reporting Widgets, you will need to set the Data properties of the Widget.

Please note, these are client side functions and so inherently insecure, however, we have introduced Server Side Javascript support and these functions are available on a server side API that are more secure. See [Server Side Scripting Overview](/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-scripting-overview/) .
