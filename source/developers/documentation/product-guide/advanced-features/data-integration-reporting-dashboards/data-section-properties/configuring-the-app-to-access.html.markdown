For Apps that display data from any external data source, you will need to configure your App to access [Queries](/developers/documentation/product-guide/the-console/console-tabs/queries/) . To do this, you select the Views property within the Data section of the Property Pane for the App. Click in the design area somewhere outside the Page to select the App Properties Pane.

You will see the above dialog which allows you to select any number of Queries as defined in the Console. To add one or more Queries into the Queries Used list, drag and drop or use the arrow buttons.

If you need friendlier or more appropriate names in your App, you can rename the Views in the Queries Used list by selecting it and then renaming in the 'Select Query Used' panel.
