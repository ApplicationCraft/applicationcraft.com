The [Grid Widget](/developers/documentation/product-guide/widget-properties-events/advanced/grid) has one or more columns. The Expression Builder will show an Item for each column you have defined in the grid. You then select a Column from the list on the left and on the right you specify the expression that maps from the View to the Grid column.

## Generate from View

When working with Grids that are displaying Data from a View you can save a lot of time by using the Generate from View feature that is available within the Columns property dialog of the Grid. This allows you to select which columns you want to have in your Grid and it then automatically defines the columns and the Fields definitions. You can then make any modifications required.
