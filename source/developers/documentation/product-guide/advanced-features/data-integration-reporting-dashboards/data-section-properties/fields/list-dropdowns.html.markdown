You can populate a Listbox or Dropdown directly from a View. Each row returned in the View populates a single item within the list. These Widgets have a two dimensional data structure consisting of

 - Label - map a View field to the text that should appear in the list

 - Value - each list item has an associated value that is not displayed and can be queried when a list selection is made.
