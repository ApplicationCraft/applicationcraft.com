## Bringing up the Expression Editor

The Expression Editor appears when a relevant property is clicked on in the property bar for a data widget. It will take on a slightly different appearance, depending on the property selected.

## Example Expressions

Expressions can vary in complexity.

 - {Orders.Total} - this would reference the 'Total' field from the Data View called 'Orders'

 - Sum({Orders.Total} - Â aggregates the total of all order in the 'Orders' Data View

 - Sum({Orders.Total} \* 1.08) - aggregates the total of all orders multiplied by 1.08

 - Sum({Orders.Total} \* [Form.Widgets.TaxPercent]) - aggregates the total of all orders multiplied by whatever value is contained within the widget 'TaxPercent'.

 - Sum({Orders.Total} + {Orders.TaxAmount}) - the total of all orders plus tax
