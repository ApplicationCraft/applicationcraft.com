This section is the must read chart resource in order to simplify the use of Charts within your Application Craft Apps. We realise that there are a lot of properties within Charts, and are working on simplifying these in the future. In this section, we hope to familiarize you with the most crucial aspects of working with charts, and focus on some of the more widely used properties associated with these Widgets.

## Data

One of the key aspects of charts is properly configuring the data views and fields. After [configuring the App to access Queries](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-integration-reporting-dashboards/data-section-properties/configuring-the-app-to-access) , select the View property inside the data section of the Chart Widget. You will then be able to select the view from a dropdown menu. In the fields property, you will then bring up the expression builder. It is worth reading about [Automatic Property Settings](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-integration-reporting-dashboards/data-section-properties/using-automatic-property-setti) in order to save yourself a lot of time.

You may also want to read the section on [Drilling Down](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/data-integration-reporting-dashboards/drilling-down) , to make your Charts even more effective at presenting the relevant data.

## Chart Properties

We will go through a few of what we feel are the most crucial chart properties here.

In the X axis section, the **Label Display property** controls the format of the label display along the X axis. You have the option to either rotate 45 or 90 degrees, wrap labels across multiple lines, display in normal single row labels, or stagger across multiple lines.

The **Show Labels property** within the Y Axis Section of the Widget properties allows you to display or hide the value labels shown at the top of the columns or bars or pie segments.

The **Label Display property** can then be used to show the labels as normal, wrapped, staggered or rotated.
