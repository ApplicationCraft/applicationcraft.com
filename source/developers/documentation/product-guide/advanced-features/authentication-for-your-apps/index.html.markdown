Application Craft allows you to build an App that can handle the following user related features that many Apps typically require

 - Signup - sign up for a new User account within an AC Account

 - Signin - allows a user to sign in to an Application (one larger App or a collection of smaller Apps making up an Application)

 - Forgotten Passwords - AC can handle the resetting of a password
