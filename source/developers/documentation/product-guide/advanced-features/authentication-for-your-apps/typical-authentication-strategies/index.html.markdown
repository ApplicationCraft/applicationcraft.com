There will typically be two ways you will employ authentication

 - If you have a relatively small application, you may want to build everything into a single App including the Signin and Signup process.

 - If your overall application is larger, you may have several Apps that handle different parts of the overall application, in which case you probably want to have an App that is dedicated to managing authentication.

## Signup and Signin

Whether you have a dedicated authentication App or not, you will probably want two pages in your App. One to manage the Signin and another for Signup (creating new user accounts). You might also have a user settings page as a third page.

The 'Signin Signup' Tutorial App has two such pages as shown below.
