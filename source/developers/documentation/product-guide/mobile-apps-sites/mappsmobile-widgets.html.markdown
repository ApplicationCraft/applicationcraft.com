You should read the [Important Mobile Widgets](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/important-mobile-widgets/) section in the [Advanced & Important Widgets](/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-important-widgets/) chapter. This goes into detail on important features of the more powerful Mobile Widget set.

## JQueryMobile

Application Craft has embedded [JQueryMobile](http://jquerymobile.com) into the Application Craft widget framework. We comment on this only because we would like to thank the JQuery team for their very high quality work. If you find that there are some things on the jquerymobile.com site that you would like to see included in Application Craft then please let us know.

## PhoneGap

[PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com) is the magic that transforms the Web Apps that come out of Application Craft into Native Apps. This lets your Apps be deployed through App Stores and it lets them access device features and hardware such as GPS, Camera, Audio, Contacts and so on.

## Ripple

[Ripple](https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/html5/download) lets you test out device features without needing to deploy to an actual device.

Thanks to all of the above for majorly improving both our own and our users' lives (well the development part of their lives at least).
