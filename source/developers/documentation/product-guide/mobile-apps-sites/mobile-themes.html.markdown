Mobile widgets manage color properties in a different way to other widgets. Each widget or, in many cases, components of a widget has Theme properties. So, for the Mobile List Widgets, for example, you will find the following properties in the Style section of the property bar

 - Mobile Theme - the color of the main list items

 - Count Theme - if the Show Count Field property is set to true, then the count bubble appears with this color theme.

 - Divider Theme - if any of the list items are set to show dividers then this controls their color.

Each Theme controls the colors and fonts of the mobile Widgets. Currently, these Themes are not modifiable by the user. However, when there is enough demand for this feature, we will add it, so you can add your own mobile theme to the standard ones shown below.

## Adding Your Own Mobile Themes

You will shortly be able to add your own extensions to Mobile Themes. If you are in a hurry, please contact support.

## The Role of Desktop Themes

Desktop Themes and Styles still have a role to play for mobile widgets in that things like Margin, Width, Height, Percent Width etc. all need to be controlled.
