To see the events for a specific Widget, you first should select the Widget. Both the App itself and the App's Pages have Events and to access these you select the Page background or the App background beyond the Page.

Next, look for the Events tab below the Widget property bar. If you press this, you will see a list of Events for the selected Widget. Once you see the Events in the property bar, you can select other widgets and see their properties also.

## Accessing a Script

Once you have selected the Event you want to use, select 'Javascript' from the drop down to write javascript. You will immediately be switched into the appropriate mode and can start editing your script.

## Switching Between Code Mode and Design Mode

Once you are in Code Mode and can see your script you can get back to Design Mode by pressing the Design Mode button at the bottom of the page, next to the page controls. Using this and the Code Mode buttons, you can toggle between the two modes.
