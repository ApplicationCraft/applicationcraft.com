      <h2 id="toc_0">How to Refer</h2>

      <p>You can refer in one of two ways. In both cases, just go ahead and enter your email in the form above.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refer by Email, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn</strong> : after entering your email address you can click on one of the social icons and it should be clear what to do next.</li>
        <li><strong>Blog or Web Site link</strong> : after entering your email address, you will see a URL, which you can copy and paste to your blog or site.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="toc_1">How We Track Referrals</h2>
      <p>We use your email address to track anyone that signs up or buys. You can then see how your referrals are doing from your Application Craft account. </p>

      <h2 id="toc_1">How You Can Track Your Referrals</h2>
      <p>We will shortly be adding a simple feature to your AC Console so you can see your referral activity and who has signed up. Even though we have not added this reporting feature yet (coming in January 2013) we are already tracking all your referrals properly.</p>
