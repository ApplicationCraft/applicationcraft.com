Application Craft ("AC") is committed to providing a stellar customer experience. As an essential part of this commitment, we offer limited free technical support to all applications running on the AC platform. Free technical support is limited to the scope, hours, contacts, and channels below.
 
##1. Scope
AC free support offering is available only for the technologies supported by the Application Craft Platform and Private Appliance, and is limited to the following:

###Installation and Configuration Issues
 - Getting started with Application Craft and problems related to the provisioning your account
 - Problems relating to the basic execution of the AC Enterprise installer

###Troubleshooting

 - Identifying problems preventing an application from starting or running on AC
 - Providing workarounds or resolutions for known problems
 - Answering general how-to questions, and providing pointers to documentation

###Not Covered
AC's technical support services do not extend to the following areas:

 - General debugging of user applications
 - Writing or rewriting a user's application code
 - Hand-holding that in the opinion of AC falls into the realm of consultancy

AC does offer a paid consulting or professional services program. If you are interested in this then please use our contact form to provide a brief description of your needs.

##2. Who can contact support?
Limited free technical support is available to all registered users of AC. Support requests will only be processed if:

 - The request is made through one of our official support channels (see below)
 - The request originates from a registered AC account user

##3. Support Channels

 **Forum** - Free technical support is available exclusively through the Application Craft Forum at <a target="_blank" href="https://getsatisfaction.com/application_craft">https://getsatisfaction.com/application_craft</a>.

 **Email** - Tickets may also be submitted by sending email from a registered Application Craft account email address to <a href="mailto:support@applicationcraft.com">support@applicationcraft.com</a> but please note that you will get a quicker response from the forum (above) as we process this as our top priority.

##4. Hours
AC support operates between 4am - 4pm Eastern Time, Monday - Friday, excluding Holidays. Support inquiries may be submitted at any time. We do not provide any response time guarantees but we realize that we generate goodwill by responding sooner rather than later. Try us out and we don't think you will be disappointed.

The AC Platform itself is monitored 24x7. See Section 5, Proactive Monitoring for more details.

##5. Proactive Monitoring
The AC Platform is monitored 24x7 by comprehensive automated systems. In the event of any issue affecting the health and operation of AC's infrastructure, core systems, or tools, our dedicated operations team is notified and will respond immediately to diagnose and correct any issues. This 24x7 monitoring covers the entire AC platform, benefitting all AC users - free as well as paying.

In the event of a platform issue, a notice will be posted on our platform status site (to be announced) to promptly communicate the impact and status of any such issue. If there's an ongoing platform issue, you do not need to submit a support ticket. Instead, monitor the status page which will always be kept up-to-date with the latest progress and information.

##6. Premium Support
