## <a id="HowManyApps"></a>How many apps can I build using the Application Craft platforms?
You may build as many as you like with both Free Trial and Pro.

## <a id="TrialLimitations"></a>What does the AC Free Platform offer?
You get all the features that we offer with the following exceptions
- You cannot export your app from the platform.
- You can use the download feature and deploy your app to your own web server.
- You are restricted to a single developer per account.
 
Can I run my apps on my own web server?
Yes, you can. Both the AC Free Platform and AC Pro Platform allow you to download an app and deploy it to any web server.
 
Can I develop an app in a Free account and then load it into someone else's Pro account?
No. You can only export from a Pro Account. You can export your app from a Pro account, cancel your subscription and then import it into someone else's Pro account. Note that exporting is for moving an entire app between accounts. If you want to deploy your app on any web server then you download (which is available to Free accounts) rather than export.
 
Purchasing & Subscriptions

If I purchase the AC Pro Platform on a month-to-month basis, can I change my mind and buy an annual subscription to get the discount?
Yes. If you decide to change to an annual subscription, you can do it anytime (even mid-month). We will pro-rate the annual for unused time on your monthly subscription. You will not, however, receive a retroactive discount.
 
What if I want to add developers to my account?
This is also easy. The AC Pro Platform costs $45 per developer per month or $450 a year per developer. You can add developers whenever you like.
 
How do I upgrade my account?
Log into your Application Craft account and click the 'Upgrade Now' image at the top of the page or by selecting the 'Upgrade Subscription' option by hovering over the drop-down icon to the right of your user name. When you have completed the upgrade an email confirmation will be sent to you. Refresh your browser (or logout/login again) to update your account. The Upgrade Now button will no longer be visible. Further confirmation of your change in account status can also be seen by re-opening the 'Upgrade Subscription' link.
 
Must I buy support if I upgrade to the AC Pro Platform?
No. You are not required to purchase support for any license at any time. Please refer to our Support Policy page. You may use the Application Craft Forum. If you require additional support, write to us and we will work with you to create a support plan that makes sense for you.
 
Can I cancel my Pro subscription before the end of the billing period?
You can cancel your annual subscription at any time but your account will continue to function until the end of the period to which you are subscribed, whether monthly or annual. Once the subscription period expires, there will be no automatic renewal of your subscription and there will be no further charges. In plain English, you can cancel midway through your monthly/annual contract but you wonâ€™t get any money back.
 
And what happens to my apps when I cancel?
Your account will be downgraded to a Free account and the usual Free account restrictions will apply. If you have more than 10 apps, then you will need to delete enough apps that there are only 10 left. 
 
Are there usage limitations?
Yes, we have an Acceptable Usage Policy document that covers both how hard your app can hit the platorm as well as prohibited content and actions.
