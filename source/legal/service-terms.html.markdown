###1. Your Agreement with Application Craft
**1.1** Your use of the Application Craft service is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "AC" means Application Craft UK Limited, located at 29 Wood Street, Stratford Upon Avon CV37 6JG, United Kingdom and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the AC Service. The “AC Services” means the services AC makes available through this website, including this website, the AC cloud computing platform, the AC APIs, any AC Add-ons, and any other software or services offered by AC in connection to any of those.

**1.2** In order to use the AC Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the AC Services. You understand and agree that AC will treat your use of the AC Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

**1.3** You may not use the AC Services if you are a person barred from receiving the AC Services under the laws of the United Kingdom or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the AC Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the AC Services are not intended for children under 13.

**1.4** You agree your purchases of AC Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by AC or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.
###2. Your Account and Use of the AC Services

**2.1** You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the AC Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify AC immediately.

**2.3** You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the AC Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by AC in connection with the AC Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with AC, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the AC Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

**2.4** Your account has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as further explained here (or such URL as AC may provide). The AC Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. AC reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion, which may result in AC serving a “quota exceeded” page to you or users to whom you serve web pages via the AC Services (“End Users”). Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.

**2.5** You may use the AC Services only to develop and run applications on the AC infrastructure. You may not access the AC Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against AC or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the AC Services.

**3.1** You agree to comply with the AC Acceptable Use Policy available at acceptable use policy (the "Acceptable Use Policy") which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.

**3.2** The AC Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the AC Services available at privacy policy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with AC's privacy policies.

**3.3** You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to AC and you must comply with all applicable data protection legislation in respect of such information.

###4. Fees for Use of the AC Services

**4.1** Subject to the Terms, the AC Services are provided to you without charge up to certain limits and with certain feature restrictions as displayed on the AC web site. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at pricing (or such URL as AC may provide).

**4.2** For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly or annual basis or at the interval indicated in AC fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and professional fees AC incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on AC measurements of your use of the AC Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of AC and only in the form of credit for the AC Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates AC to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to AC may be shared by AC with companies who work on AC behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to AC and servicing your account. AC may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as court summonses, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. AC shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. AC reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the AC Services to you for any late payments.

**4.3** AC may change its fees and payment policies for the AC Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL AC may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.

**4.4** You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the AC Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.
