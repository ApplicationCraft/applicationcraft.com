You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the AC Services are not intended for children under 13.

###2. Your Account and Use of the AC Services

**2.1** You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the AC Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account.

**2.4** Your account has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as further explained here (or such URL as AC may provide). The AC Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits.

Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.

###4. Fees for Use of the AC Services

**4.1** Subject to the Terms, the AC Services are provided to you without charge up to certain limits and with certain feature restrictions as displayed on the AC web site. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at pricing (or such URL as AC may provide).

**4.2** For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly or annual basis or at the interval indicated in AC fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and professional fees AC incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on AC measurements of your use of the AC Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of AC and only in the form of credit for the AC Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates AC to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to AC may be shared by AC with companies who work on AC behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to AC and servicing your account. AC may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as court summonses, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims.
