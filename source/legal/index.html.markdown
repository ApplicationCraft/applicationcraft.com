This page contains links to our legal terms and policies. Equally important to us are the commitments we make to you.

  - You own your code, not us.
  - You own your data, not us.
  - You will still be able to run your apps on your own web servers if you cancel your subscription (provided you are not using any server side functionality).
  - Your PhoneGap/Cordova compiled apps will run unaffected even if you cancel your subscription or downgrade to free.
  - We'll do everything we can to achieve 100% uptime.
  - We will never achieve 100% uptime, but when we fall short, we'll explain why and how we'll do better next time.
