### <a id="differences"></a>How is AC Enterprise different from AC Pro?
It offers almost entirely the same functionality. As of November 2012, we have not yet integrated the AC Mobile Build capabilities but you are able to use Phonegap:Build or AC Mobile Build within a regular AC Pro account, so it should not be much of an inconvenience.

### <a id="evaluation"></a>Can I evaluate before buying?
The best way to evaluate before buying is to use the AC Pro Free Trial or sign up for a regular AC Pro account. If you like what you see there, then you will like AC Enterprise.

### <a id="pricing"></a>How does the pricing work?
Please refer to the <a href="enterprise-pricing">Enterprise Pricing</a> page.

### <a id="license"></a>Can I see the AC Enterprise license agreement?
Please refer to the <a href="/legal/enterprise-license">Enterprise License</a> page.

### <a id="sysreq"></a>What are the system requirements?
AC Enterprise can be installed as a Debina/Ubuntu package or as a virtual machine image. The only additional software required is a compatible virtual machine environment. We can provide images for Virtual Box and VM-Ware. We do provide optional support for the installation but this is charged for at our regular support rates.

The following minimal hardware requirements are suggested for production deployments:

  - Processor: Two 3.0 GHz CPU cores (or virtual equivalent)
  - Memory: 8 GB
  - Disk: 75 GB VM root partition
  - Storage: High-performance SAN or locally attached storage

### <a id="transfer"></a>Can I transfer Apps between AC Pro and Enterprise?
Yes, you can. You can Export any App from an AC Pro account and then import it into the AC Enterprise account.

### <a id="support"></a>Is there support available?
For bug related issues there is no additional charge and it is included in your annual license. For installation and general product support you can purchase support at our normal rates. We do not offer 24x7 support, however.
