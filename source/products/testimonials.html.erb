        <p>Using Application Craft, we were able to turn our project around in a way that was not possible using any other approach we could find that did not require deep technical and mobile expertise. Being able to go from concept to a fully deployed data collection solution so quickly was impressive.</p>

            <p>Without Application Craft, we would have had to build our own framework. Using their platform was much easier and faster. We certainly would not have been able to build our desktop and iPad app in three months without Application Craft.</p>

            <p>Not only is Application Craft a brilliant idea, but the timing is ripe for such a product. Most importantly, your implementation has been superb! I am impressed and itâ€™s actually a pleasure to use the online IDE to develop apps amazingly quickly.</p>
