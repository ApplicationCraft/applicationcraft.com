## App Development
Need help building your app? The expert developers at Application Craft use our own platform to create your cross-platform applications. These can be delivered as web apps or PhoneGap/Cordova-compiled native apps that can access all device hardware and be deployed through app stores.

  - **Front Ends**
    We can build a mobile front-end to any database or web service.

  - **Proof of Concept**
    If you need to develop a quick proof of concept for your cross-platform application.

  - **Web App or App Store**
    We can build for both approaches with no extra work.

## Widget Building
Do you need functionality that is not already available in the Application Craft widget library? We can help. If something can be displayed in a browser then we can turn it into an Application Craft widget. Application Craft widgets are a great way to speed up the development process by eliminating most or all of the coding that you would otherwise need.

## Consultancy
We offer time and materials-type consultancy packages for those who need to work by the hour, week or month. This is especially suitable for ad-hoc type projects.
