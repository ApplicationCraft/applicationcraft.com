Application Craft was founded with the firm belief that the software development process has become far too complex. Since web apps, mobile and cloud have appeared on the scene, we have seen the proliferation of platforms that are either too difficult for non-expert programmers or too simple to be practical for business use. Application Craft is striving to fill that gap with a platform that removes unnecessary complexity from the mobile and desktop development process, thereby making it the right solution for developers of all skill levels.
