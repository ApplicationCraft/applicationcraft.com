Application Craft, a cloud-based app development platform that enables developers of all skill levels to create apps by killing unnecessary complexity, has launched its new cloud-based app platform to address the need for more simple yet powerful mobile application development tools for beginners as well as experienced professionals.
 
With this latest release, Application Craft has widen the doors of app development for developers of all skill levels, by allowing them to build and deploy web, native and hybrid mobile, tablet, and desktop apps in a faster and cost effective manner.
 
“App development has become hugely complex and unapproachable for many developers, so we set out to create a platform for developers of all skill levels who simply want to get their business or consumer app created professionally and out to market quickly,” said Freddy May, founder and CEO, Application Craft. “Listening to our emphatic beta users, I would say that we have already been extremely successful.”
 
The new platform uses HTML 5 widgets and comes with several advanced features like drag-and-drop interface, 1-Click PhoneGap native app creation tool, Zing charts, circular menus, signature widgets, and multi language app creation. In addition, AC Cloud Platform includes enterprise data integration, authentication, app migration, workflow, advanced widgets, database integration tools, support for Google Analytics, and much more.
 
Not only for developers in general, Application Craft’s platform is used by big giants for big data collection projects. For example, when Coca-Cola Enterprises needed an app for a last-minute data collection project for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, they turned to Application Craft. Besides, the platform is highly useful for independent software developers as a teaching tool for app development.
 
“I teach students how to build apps,” said Michael Jay Kintner, instructor and founder of CNerd.com and i360Views.com. “It is my experience that most mobile app platforms are either too complicated for students or too simple for the creation of complex apps. Application Craft has filled this gap with a platform that is simple to use, but full of the features that my students want. I use Application Craft exclusively for my classes and to build cross-platform apps for my businesses.”
 
As mobile app development is currently geared toward specialized developers and individuals that have extensive experience using HTML5, but Application Craft has built a platform on what they think are the mistakes of others in order to take the complexity out of building apps. Their vision is to kill complexity using a cross-platform, cloud based, open platform.
 
The use of smartphones is expected to continue to grow, and with that the consumption of mobile apps, mobile app developers are in high demand and many developers are scrambling to keep up with the demand. As a cloud-based app development platform, this is where Application Craft will provide a very important solution to the development world.
 
Finally, Application Craft also raised $1 million dollars in angel funding, which is being used to build the platform and hire sales, marketing and development staff in the US, UK and Russia. But a good thing amidst the scenario is that the company has built its platform with minimal outside investment (not even the above one), and is doing well of its own.
