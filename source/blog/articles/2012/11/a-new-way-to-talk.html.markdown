##A new way to talk?

We've added a really easy way for you to contact us through your account using [Intercom.io](https://www.intercom.io/ "Intercom") 

Look for the mail icon to the left of your username in the main console area and also in the design area at the top right of the browser. 

![Mail](/img/blog/mail.png "Contact Icon")


It's easy to use and allows you quick and easy access to all messages you have sent or received.

Select the icon, compose your message and send.

Its as easy as that

You can also view your conversations summary clicking here:

![View Summary](/img/blog/viewmessage.png "View Summary")

and from there you can then select a conversation

![View Conversation](/img/blog/viewconversation.png "View Conversations")

to see the conversation detail.

![View Detail](/img/blog/conversationdetail.png "Conversation Detail")

We will also be using this to let you know about new features or news so watch out for this. We'd love to know what you think so please let us know and look forward to talking to you sometime soon

Ian
