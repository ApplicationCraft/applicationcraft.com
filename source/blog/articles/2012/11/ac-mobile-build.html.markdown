Application Craft is over the moon to announce the availability of a full-featured alternative to Phonegap:Build that incorporates everything that Adobe's platform offers as well as a healthy number of plugins. 

Even better, we have made it incredibly easy to use by offering Certificate management **and** Certificate generation, all through the Application Craft platform. 

Developers of any HTML5+CSS+Javascript mobile Apps as well as Application Craft Apps have full access to all features.

##60 Second Video Overview
For those of you who want to see just how easy the whole process is, here are two very short videos for you to watch

 - Click to watch - for those who have built their Apps using the Application Craft Platform
 - Click to watch - if you have built your App in any other way

##Why we built it
Phonegap/Cordova technology is something that most developers are probably already familiar with. However, using it is not for the faint hearted. You need to install and configure XCode (for iOS), Java (for Android and Blackberry) and other compilers. This is a pain in the arse. That was why Phonegap:Build was built. However, Adobe have been rather slow is adding support for Phonegap/Cordova plugins, which is something our users have been crying out for. 

Much as we love the folks at Phonegap:Build (Adobe), we also wanted to be sure that Application Craft users were free to use the technology without sudden and unexpected changes that were beyond our control. That's why we decided to build our own.

##The Application Craft Way
We allow anyone who has built any HTML5+CSS+Javascript App, whether built with Application Craft or not, to build their Apps with a single button press. We manage the compilers and the compiling in our cloud-based platform. This will save you a huge amount of time and considerable hair loss.

##How does it differ from Phonegap:Build?
In principle, it is exactly the same. In practice, we offer free private builds **and** we also offer 6 Phonegap/Cordova plugins. This is a big deal for many people. Phonegap:Build offers very few currently although they are expanding their support for these.

Application Craft will only support iOS, Android (both available now) and Windows Phone (available from December 1st, 2012). 

##Editing your config.xml
AC Mobile Build lets you edit your config.xml within the platform. The great thing about this is that you can make the many small modifications you need to make without having to constanly edit, cmopress and uploaded each time.

##What about plugins?
Application Craft curates plugins. This means that they are built and tested by us to reduce complexity for the user. We have added the most commonly requested ones but will aggressively add more in line with demand.

  - **Child Browser Window** : this allows a user to display a URL within the app rather than it appearing in the system browser.
  - **Push Notifications** : we have integrated the Xtify system and may support others on request.
  - **Scandit Barcode Reader** : a very high quality barcode reader; it is requires a commcercial license but for mission critical barcode reading it is worth it
  - **Google ZXing** : this is a free barcode reader
  - **SQLite** : this gives you a relaltional database on your mobile device
  - **MailTo** : send emails from your device

Want more? We build plugins based on demand. If plenty of people want'em, we'll add'em. If you have a very obscure plugin you want adding, our services guys can look at that too.

##We even handle iOS and Android key generation
If you want to deploy your App to App Stores you will soon realize that you need to generate certificates. Sound easy? It's not. Especially not for iOS.

So, we have built certificate generation into the AC Mobile Build platform. Whether you have a Mac or not, we make this as easy as it possibly can be. 

##We'll even deploy your App for you
If you don't have a Mac then don't worry. The only thing that you cannot do without a Mac is to upload your finished, tested App to the iOS App Store. The good news is that we have a service that does this for you.

What this all means is that all the hard stuff is done by us. You just go about building and testing your Apps and all the technical pain is taken by us.
