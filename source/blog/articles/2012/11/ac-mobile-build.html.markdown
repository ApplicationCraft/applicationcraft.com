Our goal is to make all aspects of HTML5 mobile and desktop application development as simple and pain-free as it possibly can be.

Phonegap/Cordova technology is something that most developers are probably already familiar with. However, using it is not for the faint hearted. You need to install and configure XCode (for iOS), Java (for Android and Blackberry) and other compilers. This is a pain in the arse.

##The Application Craft Way
We allow anyone who has built any HTML5+CSS+Javascript App to build their Apps with a single button press. We then manage the compilers on our cloud-based platform so you never have to bother about them. This will save you a huge amount of time and considerable hair loss.

##Watch it happen
For those of you who want to see just how easy the whole process is, here are two very short videos for you to watch

 - If you have built your App in any other way - click here

##How does it differ from Phonegap:Build?
In principle, it is exactly the same. In practice, we offer free private builds **and** we also offer Phonegap/Cordova plugins. This is a big deal for many people. Phonegap:Build offers very few currently although they are expanding their support for these gradually.

##What about plugins?
Application Craft curates plugins. This means that they are built and tested by us to reduce complexity for the user. We have added the most commonly requested ones but will aggressively add more in line with demand.

  - Child Browser Window : this allows a user to display a URL within the app rather than it appearing in the system browser.
  - Push Notifications : we have integrated the Xtify system and may support others on request.
  - Scandit Barcode Reader : a very high quality barcode reader; it is requires a commcercial license but for mission critical barcode reading it is worth it
  - Google ZXing : this is a free barcode reader
  - SQLite : this gives you a relaltional database on your mobile device
