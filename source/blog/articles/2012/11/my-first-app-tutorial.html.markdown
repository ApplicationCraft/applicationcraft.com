##Crimes & Misdemeanours
I guess all companies commit them. Well we are now atoning for a pretty major crime - not having a really good 'Getting Started' guide so that first time users can go from zero to hero in a few minutes.

When we released our new web site, Joel also built a new framework for our all our documentation. We just finished all the major tweaks and so we are now using it for a complete set of tutorials, My First App being the first.

##8 Steps, 15 Minutes
In 8 easy steps and about 15 minutes of work, you get to build and deploy an App but you really get to play with most of the major components of Application Craft, including

 - designing a very simple UI
 - changing properties
 - writing some code
 - deployment

##Coming soon ...
My First App is the first part of some major tutorial work. The main ones we are about to start work on are

 - a complete set of **Javascript for Beginners** tutorials that use Application Craft as a great way to learn
 - a comprehensive collection of **Application Craft By Example** tutorials, which will conentrate on getting into the really meaty aspects of using the product with lots of detailed examples. 

##Feedback Please!
Please add your commments to this blog. We really do take notice so any ideas, suggestions, typo spots (etc.) are much appreciated.
