##Crimes & Misdemeanours
I guess all companies commit them. Well we are now atoning for a pretty major crime - not having a really good 'Getting Started' guide so that first time users can go from zero to hero in a few minutes.

Since we released our new web site, Joel put together a cool documentation engine that makes it really easy to add any sort of Tutorial or other similar content.

##8 Steps, 15 Minutes
What we saw is that in 8 easy steps and about 15 minutes you get to build and deploy and App but also you get to play with most of the major components of Application Craft.
