Every since we unleashed our [new site and branding](/blog/2012/11/welcome-to-the-all-new-application-craft/) to the world just a week ago, we've been hard at work making further improvements, especially to the [Documentation](/developers/documentation). Today, we added a couple of major improvements to the docs that we hope will make your life easier.

## Docs Search

The old docs had a search feature, which it seems that some of you have been pining for. So we've brought search back, but in a much sexier way.

Above the documentation tree, you will now see a search box. Simply use this to search for what you are looking for and you'll be shown a list of results from the documentation. Nice and fast!

## Full Screen Docs

You may also have noticed a little icon towards the top right of the docs. If you click that, you will be taken into full-screen mode, which will allow you to concentrate only on the docs without any distractions, and also be able to see more of the docs and code samples with much less scrolling.

## Open Source

A few days ago, I sent a tweet from the [@appcrafty](https://twitter.com/appcrafty) Twitter account:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We think our new site and docs are so good, we open sourced them <a href="https://t.co/ONYMrozB" title="https://github.com/ApplicationCraft/applicationcraft.com">github.com/ApplicationCra…</a>, and we would love to see pull requests.</p>&mdash; Application Craft (@appcrafty) <a href="https://twitter.com/appcrafty/status/271365264317235200" data-datetime="2012-11-21T21:31:35+00:00">November 21, 2012</a></blockquote>

Everything that you see here and anywhere else on our site is now open source on [Github](https://github.com/ApplicationCraft/applicationcraft.com). Which means the code behind the site and documentation is open and available for anyone to view... yes even you!

So if you see a typo, or broken link; or if a page in the docs is not looking quite right; or maybe there is a page in that you think you can improve upon, then just go ahead and [fork the site](https://github.com/ApplicationCraft/applicationcraft.com), make your changes and send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). If all looks good, we'll have no problem with accepting your pull requests, and you will see your changes on our site the next time we deploy.

Plenty more to come, so what this space.

Enjoy!
