Ahoy everyone!

Along with the many website changes we’ve been working hard at improving, such as fixing video links and cleaning up our [documentation](http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/11/documentation-search-and-full-screen/ "Application Craft Documentation blog"), we went ahead and added in another something extra to make your life easier. 

Your time’s valuable! We know that and you know that, which is why we have created an app so you can access Application Craft directly from Chrome. This 2-step process will save you time to do more important things...such as creating applications:

1. Go on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/application-craft/fnbfgfpielckjhdohmkacklnnjkdpkdc/"Chrome Web Store") 

2. Click on the ‘Add to Chrome’ tab. This will allow you to bypass signing in via the website, as having the Chrome app will have you on your way to smooth sailing directly to your personal console.

Ta da! Now the app will appear on your Chrome homepage. All done, told you it was easy.

With over 100 users using the Chrome app we invite you to jump on board to join the other happy crafters. 

Any questions? Just give us a holler!

Ta ta for now,

Hazel
