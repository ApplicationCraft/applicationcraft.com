Unless you are reading this via the [blog feed](/blog/feed.xml), you are currently witnessing the beauty and majesty that is the all new [ApplicationCraft.com](/).

We've been hard at work for the last month thinking and brainstorming about ways we can create an even better product and improve the service to you; our valued customers and developers. The site is the very first thing that people see, and is also the go-to place for existing users when they need assistance of any kind.

So what we have done is completely redefined the Application Craft brand and design. We enlisted the help of [Mike Kus](http://mikekus.com/), who is one of the worlds best web and graphic designers - and also happens to be a great guy - and we built a beautiful new brand.

The brief was simple; great looking site that was far simpler and less text heavy than the old one, and we wanted it to be instantly noticable and funky!

What Mike came up with blew us away. It includes an all new logo that we feel is much simpler, yet more effective, and the site does a far better job of explaining very quickly what AC is all about. We even invented a new colour: AC Red ;)

The [homepage](/) gets straight to the point, and our [product pages](/product) are much simpler. Heck, even the [signup form](/get-started) is simpler.

We also found the time to integrate the [User Guide and documentation](/developers/documentation) into the new site, as well as make some considerable improvements to the structure and useability.

We are very excited to release the new ApplicationCraft.com, and hope you will love it as much as we do. Tell us what you think in the comments below.
