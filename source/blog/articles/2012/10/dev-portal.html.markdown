Over the last few months we have been working towards improving and optimising our internal development processes. We have also been thinking hard about how we can include you in these processes, and to improve transparency throughout. So today, I am happy to announce the first step in that endeavour, and introduce the <a href="http://portal.applicationcraft.com" target="_blank">Application Craft Developer Portal</a>

This portal will eventually be your gateway to our large collection of help, guides, resources and assistance when working with the Application Craft platform. But this will be a stepped introduction, so right now we are opening up our bug tracker to you all, which will allow you to report bugs or possible issues to us in a much more efficient manner. This system also happens to be the same system that we use internally to manage and track development of AC, which means we get to see your issues almost immediately, and can more easily include them into our internal development processes.

In the past, bugs and issues have been reported via our <a target="_blank" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/application_craft">GetSatisfaction forums</a>, but as of now you should use the new Developer Portal to do this. Any bugs or issues that are reported to the forums will be closed and you will be asked to use the Portal instead. If you are not sure about which system to use, please use the Portal and <a target="_blank" href="http://portal.applicationcraft.com/projects/support/issues/new">create a new issue</a>  there.

So if you spot something that doesn't look or behave the way that you expect, and think it may be a bug, or perhaps there is a general issue that you feel needs to be addressed, please head on over to the new Developer Portal and create a new issue.

Watch this space for more to come. In the meantime, please feel free to leave your comments below.

Enjoy!
