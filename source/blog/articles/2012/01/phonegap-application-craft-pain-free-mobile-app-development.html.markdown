Application Craft is very tightly integrated with Phonegap:Build and today Phonegap released their Case Study highlighting this integration.

##Reproduced Content from Phonegap Site
Just as the PhoneGap mantra is fast and easy cross-platform mobile app deployment, Application Craft creators are committed to making the mobile app and content development process pain-free. No wonder these two technologies get on so well!
 
Application Craft is a cloud-based, desktop and mobile app development environment for building enterprise apps and mobile and tablet content. On top of its advanced browser-based IDE, Application Craft offers a sophisticated back end that supports database integration, data storage and more. Examples of apps built with Application Craft include the Tate Modern Museum mobile app and the JamieOliver.com app.

###So, why is Application Craft and PhoneGap a match made in heaven?

Application Craft generates 100% JavaScript apps. When combined with PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build, apps built using Application Craft can access native device features and can be automatically deployed to app stores.

PhoneGap Build--a cloud-based services that compiles PhoneGap apps for various platforms--provides a "huge bonus" because it seamlessly manages the complexities of native compilers, says Freddy May, Founder and CEO of Application Craft. "The PhoneGap Build API is icing on the cake because it meant we were able to achieve the tightest possible integration with Application Craft."

May adds that integrating the PhoneGap API into Application Craft was easy. Despite PhoneGap Build being in beta, Application Craft developers completed the integration without a single email or call to PhoneGap. The result is an app deployment feature that Application Craft is proud of--a build of five platform binaries takes about a minute. "This is more than acceptable especially when you consider it's an asynchronous process and we allow our users to work on other things as the apps compile. Once a user can specify a single platform build via the build API, it should be even faster," he says.

By adding cross-platform app compilation to Application Craft, PhoneGap Build saves developers many tedious testing hours, which translates into a major competitive advantage for the Application Craft development environment and, ultimately, makes for happier app developers.

In the last couple of weeks, Application Craft has launched a major update with a comprehensive implementation of jQueryMobile and added a new feaure allowing UI designers to build responsive design type page using the IDE.
