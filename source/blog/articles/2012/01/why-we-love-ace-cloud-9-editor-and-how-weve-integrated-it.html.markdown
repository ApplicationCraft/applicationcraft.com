There are some parts of the Application Craft system where we need to give credit to other people or products where it is due. One of these is the ACE Cloud 9 Editor from <a href="http://ace.ajax.org/" target="_blank">ACE Cloud 9 Editor</a>.

Code Editing is often an integral part of building an App and so having a really superb code editor is essential. We have successfully incorporated the ACE Editor into our IDE and we are extremely pleased with the result.

##Where we use it
The most important part of our system is the Application Craft IDE. This does 2 main things

- build UI screens with the WYSIWYG, drag-and-drop UI Layout Editor
- edit javascript code (currently client-side code and, very soon, also server-side)

##What we love about it
Here are just a few of the things we should mention

 - it saved us from having to compromise and use a component that was below the standards we try to adhere to
 - it saved us one hell of a lot of coding (given we don't like to compromise on those standards)
 - very easily tied into things like JSLint for error highlighting
 - excellent syntax highlighting
 - it has some really lovely styles
 - there are some very juicy things right round the corner such as Code Completion that we are itching to add in
 - quality

So thanks to the guys and gals behind this Editor. We appreciate it!
