We’ve undergone lots of changes at Application Craft within the past month but we’re not going to take off our construction helmets and set our tools down just yet because there’s still lots of work to be done. 

We constantly receive feedback and suggestions for improvements and new features and we’re happy to tell you that your requests are not being lost on us! 

You suggested [credit card payments](http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/10/accepting-credit-card-payments-ac-apps/), we thought, “why not?” 
We heard the call out for [barcode scanning](http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/07/scandit-partnership-enterprise-quality-barcode-scanning-application-craft/), in came our [Scandit](http://www.scandit.com/) Partnership. 
You asked for improved [documentation](http://www.scandit.com/), you got it. 
We like to keep the lines of communication open between you and us, so we were beyond excited to introduce a new method of connecting with us via [Intercom.io](http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/11/a-new-way-to-talk/).

We received such a great response from the latter that it made us think about what else we could do to improve your Application Craft experience. And thus the idea to host webinars was born. 

##Webinars!!!

We plan to organize regular webinar sessions where we will run through sessions that go through the basics of how to navigate around the console and IDE, to demonstrating how new features work. This is your chance to have some fun and interact with the Application Craft team.

Our first webinar sessions will take place next week and will act as a mini one-hour tutorial session for those who would like a better understanding of the Application Craft product.  

Tuesday December 11, 2012 - 2-3PM GMT
Thursday December 13, 2012 - 6-7PM GMT
