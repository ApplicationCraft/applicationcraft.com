Sylvain Danigo has come up with an app using Application Craft that will transform the way citizens can interact with the Canadian town of Blainville. The mobile app, named [GjiGan](http://www.gjigan.com/) (pronounced Jee-Gan), provides smartphone users both commercial and municipal information in real time. We had a chance to speak with Sylvain about the creation of GjiGan

###Tell us more about GjiGan

GjiGan is more than just a simple directory. The application presents news in real time, whether it’s municipal information, promotions, offers from local merchants, and even job listings. The application can be customized according to the type of information selected and your interests.

The app extracts news from the town’s official website so only the current and official news appears.

###Sounds great! What has the user response been like?

There are over 600 users (the app was launched last month). Citizens like it because it’s a free app and gives them the town’s current information and includes interesting features, such as interactive maps. Businesses like it because it gives them a chance to promote and advertise on the application.

###Why did you choose Application Craft?

I wanted to make mobile apps a year ago and looked at various platforms. The first thing that pulled me towards Application Craft was the fact that it is cloud-based. It’s easy to build screens and works immediately on mobile devices.

###What was your favourite aspect of Application Craft?

I really enjoyed the drag and drop. I found it easy to quickly build what I wanted. Had I chosen a different platform it would have taken me twice the amount of time, definitely.

I found the widgets easy to program, enjoyed the many functionalities Application Craft has to offer and think Application Craft is very good value for what it offers and what I’ve been able to do with it.

To make things even better, I found the support great! The forum was a good place to ask questions and I received answers very quickly, either by the Application Craft staff or from other people on the forum.

###Any future Application Craft plans?

Oh yes, I have another project lined up and have many customers asking for mobile development.

###One last question... How did you come up with GjiGan’s name?

“Gjigan” means village in the Micmac* language.

\*Here’s a little Canadian history lesson for you: Micmacs are a First Nations people, located in Canada’s Maritime Provinces and the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec, as well as some parts of New England, USA. “Micmac” both refers to the people themselves and the language they speak. The Micmac were among the first peoples to be affected by European activities in the New World and underwent early depopulation and sociocultural disruption. Quick lesson over!
