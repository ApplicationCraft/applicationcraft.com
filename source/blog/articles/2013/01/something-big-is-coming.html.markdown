Think the CIA and MI5 is full of secrets? You ain't seen nothin' yet! These last few months have been very exciting here at AC's Evil Lair. We've been planning and building something that we think will blow you all away, and it's coming very soon. The next few months will be even more exciting, and we think you are going to love it.

But unlike the secret service, we're going to show you our secrets, a little bit at a time. If you want a sneak peak, and possibly even have a little play, [click here](http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/). Watch this space as we unveil our secrets, one layer at a time.
