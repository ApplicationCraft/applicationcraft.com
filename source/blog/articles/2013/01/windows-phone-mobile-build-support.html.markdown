Hot on the heels of our new console reveal [yesterday](/blog/2013/01/all-new-console/) comes an amazing new features of [AC Mobile Build](/product/phonegap-mobile-build/). We are proud to announce official support for Windows Phone.

This means that with a click of a button, we will compile your AC and HTML5 apps for the Windows Phone platform. This is added at no additional cost, and sits alongside our current support for iOS and Android.

[AC Mobile Build](/product/phonegap-mobile-build/) is based on the open source PhoneGap/Cordova project, and is designed to allow you to build apps using HTML, CSS and Javascript, while taking advantage of device specific functionality. You can then deploy them to any iOS, Android and now Windows Phone devices, and subsequently to their respective App Stores.

And AC Mobile Build is not only for AC apps. Just upload any web app, and we will do the rest.

We hope you enjoy this new addition. And if you do, you're gonna love what else we've been working on.

Watch this space ;)
