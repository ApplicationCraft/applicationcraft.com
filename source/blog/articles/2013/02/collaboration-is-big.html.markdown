As you should already know by now, we're working on [something BIG!](/blog/2013/01/something-big-is-coming/). It's an all new cloud based software development platform. And it will be the very first cloud based IDE that every developer will love to use, day in and day out. Please [register your interest](http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/) and we'll let you in on the first public beta.

Collaboration is the very first thing we thought about when we first sat down to plan the next major version of Application Craft, and has continued to be at the very heart of almost everything we are building.

Collaboration is arguably the single biggest advantage when using software in the browser, because the browser is constantly connected via the internet, and because the browser is now the most used application on almost any device. Collaboration is also hugely important when writing software and especially when building for the web. It empowers us to do more, while remaining in the [virtual] company of our friends and colleague's.

The cost of collaborating between you and others when using the browser and the internet are zero. Email, Twitter, Skype - these are all free to use, and they are all about collaboration.

Ah, but now I hear a few of you asking the question "**what if I don't have anyone to collaborate with?**". The answer to that is easy and simple... **you do!**

The world is full of like-minded people just like you. People who love building web apps, designing web sites, or creating mobile applications. And they all have something to share, even you! And whether you realise it or not, you co-ordinate and collaborate every single day, with people you have never met or spoken to before. No matter what accomplishments you make, somebody helped you.

The largest sites are essentially all about encouraging collaboration and making it easier for us to co-ordinate with each other. Sites and apps like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Wikipedia, Github, Basecamp, and now Application Craft are leading the way here.

Collaboration is *extremely* powerful, and we think you're going to love what you will be able to do with [what we have planned](http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/).
