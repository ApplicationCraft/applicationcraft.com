        <h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/what-mark-zuckerberg-really-said-about-html5/">What Mark Zuckerberg Really Said About HTML5</a></h1>
        
          <img alt="What Mark Zuckerberg Really Said About HTML5" align="left" class="blog-img" src="/img/blog/zuckerberg_ready-sfSpan-fe0b7176.jpeg" />
        
        <p>Let&#39;s take a quick look at the attention grabbing headline that was issued for maximum publicity rather than maximum fact: Mark Zuckerberg called Facebook&#39;s HTML5 app </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>One of the biggest mistakes if not the biggest strategic mistake that we made.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before you stop reading (and thinking), let&#39;s look at what else he said in the same speech.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&#39;s not that HTML5 is bad. I&#39;m actually, long-term, really excited about it. One of the things that&#39;s interesting is we actually have more people on a daily basis using mobile Web Facebook than we have using our iOS or Android apps combined. So mobile Web is a big thing for us.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The decision two years ago to build their mission-critical apps using HTML5 was a bad one, yes. Two years ago this was true for all companies IF:  a) your company stands to live or die by one app b) you have extremely picky consumer users (as opposed to employee users for example) and c) you have a generous budget. If you said yes to a, b and c,  then native is, for the time being, the way to go. </p>

<p>But the technology is changing fast and HTML5 today offers an app experience that is much closer to native than two years. And the truth of the matter is, most B2B apps and even certain consumer apps don&#39;t live under the demands of a Facebook app. Most apps today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Need to run on Android, iOS and perhaps soon Windows Phone and for each platform you want to support you have to code it completely differently when building a native app. Can you REALLY afford this? P.S. Don&#39;t forget to add in the maintenance costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Are built with tight budgets. We estimate there is about a 15% difference in app performance with native, over HTML5. A gap that is shrinking fast. That 15% is often important for games and CPU intensive apps, but not all the rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Are not the only app. Most organizations need more than one app. In fact, we see that formerly desktop-bound software is now increasingly built as a mobile app for increasingly mobile professional. Many of our corporate clients are building dozens of apps each year for their customers, sales, finance and marketing teams. In these cases, speed of development is hugely important, cost is a determining factor, and native just isn&#39;t an option.</p></li>
<li><p>Are built by developers that that are not experts in both Objective-C and Java. Very few developers have that skill level in multiple languages and therefore cannot quickly build multiple apps for different platforms.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, a look at the future - time is on the side of HTML5. Smartphone performance is accelerating and HTML5 implementations are getting more and more sophisticated. In a couple of years, the differences between HTML5 and native apps will be negligible in all but the most extreme conditions. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s all agree that headlines implying HTML5 is dead are absurd. HTML5 apps will dominate before too long. I will stake my reputation and my company on it.</p>

        <h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/application-craft-launches-cloud-based-app-platform-gets-1-million-funding/">Application Craft Launches Cloud-Based App Platform, Gets $1 Million in Funding</a></h1>
        
        <p>By Isha Suri in SiliconANGLE</p>

<p>Application Craft, a cloud-based app development platform that enables developers of all skill levels to create apps by killing unnecessary complexity, has launched its new cloud-based app platform to address the need for more simple yet powerful mobile application development tools for beginners as well as experienced professionals.</p>

<p>With this latest release, Application Craft has widen the doors of app development for developers of all skill levels, by allowing them to build and deploy web, native and hybrid mobile, tablet, and desktop apps in a faster and cost effective manner.</p>

<p>“App development has become hugely complex and unapproachable for many developers, so we set out to create a platform for developers of all skill levels who simply want to get their business or consumer app created professionally and out to market quickly,” said Freddy May, founder and CEO, Application Craft. “Listening to our emphatic beta users, I would say that we have already been extremely successful.”</p>

<p>The new platform uses HTML 5 widgets and comes with several advanced features like drag-and-drop interface, 1-Click PhoneGap native app creation tool, Zing charts, circular menus, signature widgets, and multi language app creation. In addition, AC Cloud Platform includes enterprise data integration, authentication, app migration, workflow, advanced widgets, database integration tools, support for Google Analytics, and much more.</p>

<p>Not only for developers in general, Application Craft’s platform is used by big giants for big data collection projects. For example, when Coca-Cola Enterprises needed an app for a last-minute data collection project for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, they turned to Application Craft. Besides, the platform is highly useful for independent software developers as a teaching tool for app development.</p>

<p>“I teach students how to build apps,” said Michael Jay Kintner, instructor and founder of CNerd.com and i360Views.com. “It is my experience that most mobile app platforms are either too complicated for students or too simple for the creation of complex apps. Application Craft has filled this gap with a platform that is simple to use, but full of the features that my students want. I use Application Craft exclusively for my classes and to build cross-platform apps for my businesses.”</p>

<p>As mobile app development is currently geared toward specialized developers and individuals that have extensive experience using HTML5, but Application Craft has built a platform on what they think are the mistakes of others in order to take the complexity out of building apps. Their vision is to kill complexity using a cross-platform, cloud based, open platform.</p>

<p>The use of smartphones is expected to continue to grow, and with that the consumption of mobile apps, mobile app developers are in high demand and many developers are scrambling to keep up with the demand. As a cloud-based app development platform, this is where Application Craft will provide a very important solution to the development world.</p>

<p>Finally, Application Craft also raised $1 million dollars in angel funding, which is being used to build the platform and hire sales, marketing and development staff in the US, UK and Russia. But a good thing amidst the scenario is that the company has built its platform with minimal outside investment (not even the above one), and is doing well of its own.</p>

        <h1><a href="/blog/2012/07/scandit-partnership-enterprise-quality-barcode-scanning-application-craft/">Scandit Partnership - Enterprise quality barcode scanning in AC</a></h1>
        
          <img alt="Scandit Partnership - Enterprise quality barcode scanning in AC" align="left" class="blog-img" src="/img/blog/scandit-logo-8f09172b.png" />
        
        <p>If you take the compute power of a modern mobile phone or tablet and add in the high-res camera you end up with a highly intelligent, customizable barcode scanner. The ease with which you can build apps using Application Craft combined with the high quality, plug-and-play nature of the Scandit barcode scanner SDK opens up a plethora of barcode oriented applications.</p>

<p>High quality, real world barcode recognition is not an easy thing to do well. Barcodes are not always in perfect condition, lighting conditions can vary as can the camera angle and distance. There are several products and libraries available that handle barcode scanning with varying degrees of success. After looking at most of these, we feel that the Scandit barcode scanner SDK offers the most accurate recognition when faced with real-world challenges, which is why we are pleased to announce our partnership with Scandit as well as a new Scandit ‘widget’ for Application Craft.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Hello World of Barcode Apps</h2>

<p>Application Craft can be used to build both highly complex and extremely simple web and mobile applications. Let&#39;s look at the simplest end of the scale and show just how easy the app + barcode process can be. There&#39;s a quick video below and a step-by-step version below that.</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Qjt3pkZXJn8" width="560"></iframe>

<h3 id="toc_1">1. Drag the Scandit widget onto the page</h3>

<p>Having created a new App in the Application Craft Console,  you enter IDE and locate the Scandit Widget in the Toolbox in the left pane. One minute later you have your UI ready.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">2. Set the widget’s properties</h3>

<p>Next, we select the widget and look across to the Property Bar on the right hand side. Here we can customize all important properties such as </p>

<ul>
<li>your Scandit App Key</li>
<li>the text strings that appear to the user when scanning</li>
<li>colors of target boxes</li>
<li>whether the phone beeps or vibrates after a successful scan</li>
<li>whether to allow regular 1D codes (normal barcodes) and/or 2D barcodes (QR and other codes)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_3">3. Customize your AC Events</h3>

<p>The last step in the setup process is to customize the 2 Application Craft Events provided by the Scandit widget</p>

<ul>
<li>onSuccess - a barcode was successfully read and you are passed the type of barcode as parameter 1 and the actual barcode value in parameter 2; you would normally then display this value in a field elsewhere in your App.</li>
<li>onFail - usually called when the user presses ‘Cancel’ in the scanning window</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_4">4. Build your App</h3>

<p>With most Application Craft Apps, you can now simply run your App directly from the IDE. However, because the Scandit component is a binary component that is not part of HTML5, we need to build a PhoneGap/Cordova App. Application Craft supports PhoneGap/Cordova fully, allowing all PhoneGap properties to be customized if you want.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Finally</h2>

<p>As of July 10 2012 you can now also access a wealth of UPC-based product data via Scandit’s new Product API. More information about Scandit, including technical support documentation, can be found on the Scandit site.</p>

        <h1><a href="/blog/2012/01/phonegap-application-craft-pain-free-mobile-app-development/">PhoneGap + Application Craft = Pain-Free Mobile App Development</a></h1>
        
          <img alt="PhoneGap + Application Craft = Pain-Free Mobile App Development" align="left" class="blog-img" src="/img/blog/phonegap-4c947beb.gif" />
        
        <p>Application Craft is very tightly integrated with PhoneGap:Build and today PhoneGap released their Case Study highlighting this integration.</p>

<p><a href="http://phonegap.com/case/2011/11/07/phonegap-application-craft-pain-free-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to go to see it on the PhoneGap Site.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Reproduced Content from PhoneGap Site</h2>

<p>Just as the PhoneGap mantra is fast and easy cross-platform mobile app deployment, Application Craft creators are committed to making the mobile app and content development process pain-free. No wonder these two technologies get on so well!</p>

<p>Application Craft is a cloud-based, desktop and mobile app development environment for building enterprise apps and mobile and tablet content. On top of its advanced browser-based IDE, Application Craft offers a sophisticated back end that supports database integration, data storage and more. Examples of apps built with Application Craft include the Tate Modern Museum mobile app and the JamieOliver.com app.</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/whvMQg2R-sI" width="560"></iframe>
 

<h3 id="toc_1">So, why is Application Craft and PhoneGap a match made in heaven?</h3>

<p>Application Craft generates 100% Javascript apps. When combined with PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build, apps built using Application Craft can access native device features and can be automatically deployed to app stores.</p>

<p>PhoneGap Build--a cloud-based services that compiles PhoneGap apps for various platforms--provides a &quot;huge bonus&quot; because it seamlessly manages the complexities of native compilers, says Freddy May, Founder and CEO of Application Craft. &quot;The PhoneGap Build API is icing on the cake because it meant we were able to achieve the tightest possible integration with Application Craft.&quot;</p>

<p>May adds that integrating the PhoneGap API into Application Craft was easy. Despite PhoneGap Build being in beta, Application Craft developers completed the integration without a single email or call to PhoneGap. The result is an app deployment feature that Application Craft is proud of--a build of five platform binaries takes about a minute. &quot;This is more than acceptable especially when you consider it&#39;s an asynchronous process and we allow our users to work on other things as the apps compile. Once a user can specify a single platform build via the build API, it should be even faster,&quot; he says.</p>

<p>By adding cross-platform app compilation to Application Craft, PhoneGap Build saves developers many tedious testing hours, which translates into a major competitive advantage for the Application Craft development environment and, ultimately, makes for happier app developers.</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MPAaKYGipDo" width="560"></iframe>

<p>In the last couple of weeks, Application Craft has launched a major update with a comprehensive implementation of jQueryMobile and added a new feaure allowing UI designers to build responsive design type page using the IDE.
