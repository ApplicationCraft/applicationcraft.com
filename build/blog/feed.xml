    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As much as we all hate bugs and problems, they happen, and it&amp;#39;s also nice to see a lot of you reporting problems in our &lt;a href="http://portal.applicationcraft.com" target="_blank"&gt;Developer Portal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#39;d throw out a few tips to help you out, and explain the basics of what we do with your tickets. We&amp;#39;ve already made a few tweaks from comments that have been made, so if you have any thoughts/ideas don&amp;#39;t be shy - we&amp;#39;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#39;d throw out a few tips to help you out, and explain the basics of what we do with your tickets. We&amp;#39;ve already made a few tweaks from comments that have been made, so if you have any thoughts/ideas don&amp;#39;t be shy - we&amp;#39;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Raising a problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete all the fields! Not only the platform (eg iOS/Android) but also what OS is involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attach an app which we can import into our test accounts and quickly and easily recreate the problem. Don&amp;#39;t forget to also include a &amp;#39;step by step&amp;#39; of what to do in your app so we know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example or test app is even better. An export of your app (the .acft file) is preferred and not a download (.zip file) or compiled package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t export your app then show us the problem in a video. The old adage: &amp;#39;A picture is worth a thousand words&amp;#39; really is true. Screen shots can also be helpful. It may seem counter intuitive but even if your problem is only experienced on a mobile device, and you can&amp;#39;t easily video that, being able to walk through how to recreate the problem from the desktop app to show the steps can be a lot easier than trying to write it down step by step. &lt;a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing" target="_blank"&gt;Jing&lt;/a&gt; is very good for doing this. Give it a go next time you have a problem, and simply post the link to the screencast in your ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can do the above it will help speed up the time it takes us to recreate the problem and get it fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;What have we released and when?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve added in a new field to the ticket &lt;em&gt;Planned for Ver&lt;/em&gt; that is being set with the version we plan to release the fix for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve set up some &lt;strong&gt;Custom Queries&lt;/strong&gt; that you can use to see what was released in past versions. As we release new updates I&amp;#39;ll create new queries as we do  (eg 1.28.1, 1.28.2) and as we release a new version (eg 1.29, 1.30). I will then combine all the updates into one query (eg 1.26.x, 1.27.x).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Custom Queries" alt="Send" src="/img/blog/queries-499c6b7b.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up your own queries on demand but if you have ones that you would like to be publically available, let me know and I&amp;#39;ll sort something out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Ticket Status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a new issue is raised, it is given the status of &amp;#39;New&amp;#39;. But what happens next and when are you then able to test/check that we&amp;#39;ve sorted out the problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test the fix when the status changes to &lt;em&gt;Deployed/Released&lt;/em&gt; as that is when the fix is released.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Ticket Workflow" alt="Send" src="/img/blog/ticketwf-70cf1501.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between these 2 steps, there are a number of process steps. If your explanation isn&amp;#39;t clear we may get back to you changing the status to &lt;em&gt;To Clarify&lt;/em&gt;, but in most cases (and especially if you include an example app) the next step would be to set the status to &lt;em&gt;Acknowledged&lt;/em&gt; for the developers to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch out for the change to the &lt;em&gt;Planned for Ver&lt;/em&gt; flag to indicate what version this is due to be released in. This will be done when our QA team have tested internally and passed it as OK to release. In most cases this will be the next release we make, but if there are other things we need to do (update the docs for example), it may be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;Keep it Clean&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have confirmed all is OK, please add a comment to the ticket to let us know and we can then close it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Private Posts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you raised your ticket as a Private post (ie includes information you would not want to have in the public domain, export of an app, screen shots, etc.), we would like to make these Public when they have been closed, so others can also see if they have or had a similar problem.  Please delete any attachments/comments that you wanted private and then un-check the private flag as you confirm back all is Ok for us to close the ticket and the rest of the community can then see what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;jQuery Mobile and UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jQuery Mobile is one of the core parts of AC, and every single app uses at least some part of the open source framework.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Friday we shipped quite a large new release which I think is worth mentioning. As well as some significant bugs being squashed, we upgraded jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI, and integrated the Weinre Mobile Debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;jQuery Mobile and UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jQuery Mobile is one of the core parts of AC, and every single app uses at least some part of the open source framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in October, the team behind jQuery &lt;a href="http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/10/02/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-0-final/"&gt;released a major new version; 1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release brings a new popup widget, an autodivider and collapsible option for listviews, and over 100 enhancements and fixes throughout the library to make things smoother, faster, and more polished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/10/02/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-0-final/"&gt;Check out the blog post&lt;/a&gt; for a run down of what&amp;#39;s new in jQuery Mobile 1.2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of AC now includes this latest and greatest version of jQuery, and also because of it&amp;#39;s reliance on jQuery UI, we&amp;#39;ve included the latest version of that into this release too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is anything new in jQuery Mobile 1.2 that you would like to see in AC, such as any new or improved widgets, please post in the &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/application_craft"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; and ask others to comment. If we see demand for a feature we will try our best to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Mobile Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also shipped a new feature to allow you to debug your apps right within the devices you are developing for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinre (Pronounced like the word &amp;quot;winery&amp;quot;) is a debugger for web pages, like FireBug (for FireFox) and Web Inspector (for WebKit-based browsers), except it&amp;#39;s designed to work remotely, and in particular, to allow you debug web pages on a mobile device such as a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Weinre Debugging" src="/img/blog/weinre-55f96c1d.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AC Weinre Debugging server lets you use the familiar webkit developer tools to debug your mobile web apps, and is yet another way that we are making it easier to build apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check it out at &lt;a href="http://mobile-build-debug.applicationcraft.com/"&gt;http://mobile-build-debug.applicationcraft.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Application Craft VS Appcelerator Titanium</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/blog/2012/12/application-craft-vs-appcelerator-titanium/"/>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We received an interesting question a few days ago. Someone asked us what advantages Application Craft has over Appcelerator&amp;#39;s Titanium. I thought it was a really good question, and one that I wanted to explore a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;100% Cloud Based&lt;/h2&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We received an interesting question a few days ago. Someone asked us what advantages Application Craft has over Appcelerator&amp;#39;s Titanium. I thought it was a really good question, and one that I wanted to explore a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;100% Cloud Based&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first biggest advantage over Titanium and most other development platforms, is that AC is 100% cloud based. From the moment you &lt;a href="/get-started"&gt;sign up for the free trial&lt;/a&gt;, right through to [optionally] compiling and running your finished application, the whole experience requires nothing more than your favourite browser and an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our web based console and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are all that is needed to build any kind of app that you wish. Titanium can have quite a few requirements, including Java, Python, Android SDK&amp;#39;s, Apple xCode (if you have a Mac).  You even have to download the Titanium IDE! Download an IDE?! It&amp;#39;s not 1999 you know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AC there is no requirement for you to download or install anything at all. Your browser is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Visual Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second big advantage to building your apps with AC, is that you can do so with very little code. In most cases, all you need to do is drag and drop a widget here and there, and then plumb these together using our simple events system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widgets are at the heart of any AC app, and we have dozens of them for you to use. From simple label and text widgets, to full-on charting. Every single one of these are simply dragged and dropped onto a page in your app, and configured to your requirements by setting a few properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you need to write some code, you can do so using the integrated code editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a Titanium app definately requires a lot technical experience and knowledge, which is something that we have worked hard to reduce for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;We host your apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are building a web app, we will host it at no extra cost to you. No need to find and pay for a web hosting provider, and no need to setup and configure your hosting. You save your app, and its hosted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;Mobile Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to release your apps on mobile and tablet devices via the app stores, you can do that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one click, &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/product/phonegap-mobile-build/"&gt;AC Mobile Build&lt;/a&gt; will build and compile your web app for use as a native mobile app, opening up the device features to you, along with a host of plugins that will add even more functionality to your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Server Side Javascript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can do almost anything with client side code, there may come a time when you need the power and security of a server. &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-scripting-overview/"&gt;Server-Side-Javascript (SSJ)&lt;/a&gt; allows you to write Javascript code which is then run on the server, and makes it even easier to work with data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on, but I&amp;#39;ll save the smaller differences for another day. But hopefully, you can see that there are some pretty amazing advantages to using Application Craft, and you can &lt;a href="/get-started"&gt;enjoy them all for only $14 per month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’ve undergone lots of changes at Application Craft within the past month but we’re not going to take off our construction helmets and set our tools down just yet because there’s still lots of work to be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We constantly receive feedback and suggestions for improvements and new features and we’re happy to tell you that your requests are not being lost on us! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You suggested &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/10/accepting-credit-card-payments-ac-apps/"&gt;credit card payments&lt;/a&gt;, we thought, “why not?” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We heard the call out for &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/07/scandit-partnership-enterprise-quality-barcode-scanning-application-craft/"&gt;barcode scanning&lt;/a&gt;, in came our &lt;a href="http://www.scandit.com/"&gt;Scandit&lt;/a&gt; Partnership. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You asked for improved &lt;a href="http://www.scandit.com/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, you got it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We like to keep the lines of communication open between you and us, so we were beyond excited to introduce a new method of connecting with us via &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/11/a-new-way-to-talk/"&gt;Intercom.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received such a great response from the latter that it made us think about what else we could do to improve your Application Craft experience. And thus the idea to host webinars was born. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Webinars!!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to organize regular webinar sessions where we will run through sessions that go through the basics of how to navigate around the console and IDE, to demonstrating how new features work. This is your chance to have some fun and interact with the Application Craft team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first webinar sessions will take place next week and will act as a mini one-hour tutorial session for those who would like a better understanding of the Application Craft product.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday December 11, 2012 - 2-3PM GMT&lt;br&gt;
Thursday December 13, 2012 - 6-7PM GMT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/#upcoming-webinars"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; now - We would love it if you came along and joined us! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazingly Easy Authentication with OAuth</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/blog/2012/12/oauth-support/"/>

&lt;p&gt;We currently provide explicit support for Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox but we&amp;#39;ll soon be adding support for more OAuth providers, as well as allowing you to make your own OAuth definitions so any service that supports OAuth can be defined in the AC Console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently added &lt;a href="http://oauth.net/"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt; support to Application Craft, and in the usual Application Craft way, we&amp;#39;ve made it amazingly simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently provide explicit support for Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox but we&amp;#39;ll soon be adding support for more OAuth providers, as well as allowing you to make your own OAuth definitions so any service that supports OAuth can be defined in the AC Console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Authentication for your Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the simpler uses for OAuth is to provide access to your App. You let a 3rd party service like Twitter or Facebook handle the login process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentication is as easy as shown below. You call &lt;code&gt;OAuthSignIn()&lt;/code&gt; and that&amp;#39;s it. The service pops up in a browser window, handles the login and returns an access token. You can store that token in a cookie so when your users access your App in the future, they don&amp;#39;t have to login again (until the service decides to expire it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function handler_btnAuth_onClick(mouseev){
  // See if we already have an old Access Token
  _accessToken = app.getCookie(&amp;quot;myTwitterSession&amp;quot;);
  if (_accessToken === null || _accessToken === &amp;quot;&amp;quot;) {
    // No, we don&amp;#39;t have one so get a new one
    app.OAuthSignIn(&amp;#39;twitter&amp;#39;, authCallback);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Calling OAuth secured APIs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get much more interesting when you want to access APIs from services such as Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox. Using our OAuth support, you can access the full functionality of those services in a way that is remarkably easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short example shows the code for sending a Tweet via Twitter. It is actually made up of two parts - the code running on the client ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function handler_btnTweet_onClick(mouseev){
    app.callSSJ(&amp;#39;sendTweet&amp;#39;, function(error, data){
  if(error) {
    // Some error occurred (maybe the 
    // Access Token has expired)
  } else {
    app.showMessage(&amp;quot;OAuth Demo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Message successfully tweeted!&amp;quot;);  
  }
}, [_accessToken, txtTweetMessage]);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and the server side code that gets called by &lt;code&gt;app.callSSJ()&lt;/code&gt; in the above example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function sendTweet(accessToken, txtTweet) {
ssj.OAuthRequest(accessToken, 
    &amp;#39;https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json&amp;#39;,    
    &amp;#39;POST&amp;#39;, { status: txtTweet });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen OAuth handled that straightforward? Application Craft does all the dirty work and heavy lifting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ahoy everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the many website changes we’ve been working hard at improving, such as fixing video links and cleaning up our &lt;a title="Application Craft Documentation blog" href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/11/documentation-search-and-full-screen/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, we went ahead and added in another something extra to make your life easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your time’s valuable! We know that and you know that, which is why we have created an app so you can access Application Craft directly from Chrome. This 2-step process will save you time to do more important things... such as creating applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go on the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/application-craft/fnbfgfpielckjhdohmkacklnnjkdpkdc/"&gt;Chrome Web Store&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the ‘Add to Chrome’ tab. This will allow you to bypass signing in via the website, as having the Chrome app will have you on your way to smooth sailing directly to your personal console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Add to Chrome" src="/img/blog/1addchrome-df91bbda.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ta da! Now the app will appear on your Chrome homepage. All done, told you it was easy.&lt;/p&gt;
