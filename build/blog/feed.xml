    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while ago I wrote about &lt;a href="/blog/2012/10/worlds-first-full-featured-ide/"&gt;what an IDE really is&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, we&amp;#39;ve been thinking hard and working even harder to realise that dream of a real IDE in the browser, and one that can go head to head with any desktop IDE. This is not without its challenges, so I wanted to write a little about how we are tackling these challenges head on, and to reveal a little more about something BIG that we announced &lt;a href="/blog/2013/01/something-big-is-coming/"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;From the Desktop...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets start by talking a little bit about the current state of the IDE landscape, which, to be honest is pretty bleak. On the desktop, the space is dominated by the likes of Adobe&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/dreamweaver"&gt;Dreamweaver&lt;/a&gt; and the open source &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse IDE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreamweaver is traditionally the kind of tool that new, fresh faced developers start with. I remember it was the IDE that I used to build my very first website back in 1998, and I also remember the god-awful and monstrous HTML markup it produced when publishing or exporting your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreamweaver has moved on greatly since then (it has had to) and now outputs shiny clean markup. It&amp;#39;s support for web standards has also greatly improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreamweaver has a large community around it, which has helped to create its large library of widgets, making it easy to add commonly used components into your pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipse is an altogether different beast, which is due largely to it being an open source project. This means it has a huge community of users and developers building in and on it. Whatever you are building, you can be sure that there is an Eclipse plugin that will help you out with your task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Eclipse can be very heavy at times, and is certainly not very friendly for those of you who are new to the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage to Eclipse and almost all IDE&amp;#39;s lies in its extensibility. The ability for any developer to extend and customise his/her tools is extremely powerful and very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;To the Browser...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desktop will always be with us, but like any platform, it has its limitations and its traditions. All of which can be very hard to counter. The desktop is also much slower to react to the changing pace of development and technology. The browser however, is an open door, and moves extremely fast when it comes to embracing the latest and greatest, which means it is now possible to emulate the power of the desktop right within your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The browser is deeply embedded into our digital lives and is the most used desktop application by far. So it stands to reason that we are seeing more and more desktop applications now moving into the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDE is no exception. However, no-one has yet managed to replicate the good parts of the desktop IDE&amp;#39;s in the browser. Well... that is until &lt;a href="http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;It&amp;#39;s a Big Task, but someone has to do it!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Something BIG is coming! &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Find out more...&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;" alt="Something BIG!" src="/img/blog/something-big-053c1ff0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re building an IDE that any type of developer will love to use on a day-to-day basis. A code editor that has all the functionality of the best desktop editors, including code-completion, split-panes and live preview. A development environment that can compete with the best desktop IDE&amp;#39;s, and support the basics, along with the most advanced features, such as source control, debugging, compilation/building, and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we&amp;#39;re adding a layer of conveniance on top of all this, that will use the expertise that we have built into the current version of AC, empowering novices and the less technical of you to build web and mobile apps extremely fast. Including a widget library that you can use with a simple and drag and drop, and a pixel perfect layout manager to allow you to design your app in an extremely easy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are making sure that you can work the way you want to work, which means building an IDE that is extendable and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of this has your juices flowing, then we want you to &lt;a href="http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/"&gt;join in the fun&lt;/a&gt;. Something big is coming...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Mobile Build support for Windows Phone" alt="Windows Phone" src="/img/blog/winphone-37269549.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that with a click of a button, we will compile your AC and HTML5 apps for the Windows Phone platform. This is added at no additional cost, and sits alongside our current support for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/product/phonegap-mobile-build/"&gt;AC Mobile Build&lt;/a&gt; is based on the open source PhoneGap/Cordova project, and is designed to allow you to build apps using HTML, CSS and Javascript, while taking advantage of device specific functionality. You can then deploy them to any iOS, Android and now Windows Phone devices, and subsequently to their respective App Stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And AC Mobile Build is not only for AC apps. Just upload any web app, and we will do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy this new addition. And if you do, you&amp;#39;re gonna love what else we&amp;#39;ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over Christmas we introduced the easiest yet way for you to to create, read, update and delete data in any AC application. We partnered up with &lt;a href="http://parse.com"&gt;Parse&lt;/a&gt; to provide an extremely low barrier to entry data backend using their &lt;a href="https://parse.com/docs/rest#objects"&gt;Objects API&lt;/a&gt;. Making the whole &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"&gt;CRUD&lt;/a&gt; process amazingly easy to implement into any app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into too much detail here as the &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/parse/objects/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; already does that well. So instead I will prove to you you just how easy it is to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Available Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have created a new &lt;code&gt;parse.objects&lt;/code&gt; class which your app has access to. This new class contains 5 methods which cover everything you need to create, read, update and delete data, as well as a powerful querying API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectcreate"&gt;parse.objects.create()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectread"&gt;parse.objects.read()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectupdate"&gt;parse.objects.update()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectdelete"&gt;parse.objects.delete()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectquery"&gt;parse.objects.query()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Example Scenario&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep a record of my book collection, including details of each book. So lets start by creating an object (or record) for each book in my collection (I only have one right now):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.create(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, {
  title: &amp;#39;The Lord of the Rings&amp;#39;,
  author: &amp;#39;JRR Tolkien&amp;#39;
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return a Javascript object containing the &lt;code&gt;objectId&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;createdAt&lt;/code&gt; date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  objectId: &amp;quot;DM5XhFTiPR&amp;quot;,
  createdAt: &amp;quot;2013-01-14T11:41:24.174Z&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot to add the publication date, so let&amp;#39;s update my record:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.update(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;DM5XhFTiPR&amp;#39;, {
  publishedAt: &amp;quot;1954-07-21T00:00:00.000Z&amp;quot;
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look at our updated object using the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.read(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;DM5XhFTiPR&amp;#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our object now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  title: &amp;#39;The Lord of the Rings&amp;#39;,
  author: &amp;#39;JRR Tolkien&amp;#39;,
  publishedAt: &amp;#39;1954-07-21T00:00:00.000Z&amp;#39;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that my wife just threw away my book, so I now need to delete this object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.delete(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;DM5XhFTiPR&amp;#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But being a good wife that she is, she bought me a shiny new replacement, along with a few others for me to read. So I created a new record for each of my new books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have quite a few books in collection, but want to find only those written by JRR Tolkien:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.query(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, {
  where: {
    author: &amp;#39;JRR Tolkien&amp;#39;
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above will return me a &lt;code&gt;results&lt;/code&gt; array, containing all objects which have an author of &amp;#39;JRR Tolkien&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the basics, and there is of course a lot more that you can do, including some pretty advanced querying. But you should be able to see from the above how quick and easy it is to use the new Parse powered database support in Application Craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/parse/"&gt;Check out the docs&lt;/a&gt; for more, and leave your comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have just completed full support for Push Notifications in Application Craft, and have teamed up with &lt;a href="http://www.xtify.com"&gt;Xtify&lt;/a&gt;, who provide the underlying push technology. You will need to create an Account with them, although this is free (you start paying Xtify once you reach large volumes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also added a new drop-in API that makes it ridiculously easy to add support for push notifications in your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How easy? Well this is all it takes ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create an App in Application Craft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create an App in Xtify for &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/configuration/iOS/xtify-ios-portal-setup/"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/configuration/android/xtify-android-portal-setup/"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You generate your iOS / Android keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You add the following code to your App&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function notificationReceived() {
    // Your own, optional callback function
    // Called when your App receives the notification
}

function handler_application_onAppStarted(){
    xtify.applicationKeyiOS = &amp;quot;12345678-9754-4ffc-be65-ecd00a482269&amp;quot;;
    xtify.applicationKeyAndroid = &amp;quot;abcdefg-9754-4ffc-be65-ecd00a482269&amp;quot;;
    xtify.startedCallback = notificationReceived;
    xtify.init();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You send out the Notification from &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/xtify-push-message/"&gt;Xtify&lt;/a&gt;, or from your own App using &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/apis/xtify-notification-api/"&gt;our API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;The AC Xtify API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have added our own API that sits in front of the Xtify system and makes life really very easy for you. However, you can always access the Xtify API directly if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of this are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease-of-use is at the top of the list; less experienced developers may struggle with Xtify&amp;#39;s own API and so we have simplified things for all common operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows you to operate in test mode, so you can test lots of things from your desktop rather than a mobile device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single call &amp;#39;xtify.location.update()&amp;#39; that automatically tells the Xtify system where the user is located. You can then set up auto notifications based on a user&amp;#39;s location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cool &amp;#39;Tag API&amp;#39; that lets your App tag users with any information you require, typically information gathered from the App itself. You can then send out notifications only to those users with certain tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
