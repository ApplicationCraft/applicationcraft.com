&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We live not in a passive society, a read-only society, but in a writable society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is the very first thing we thought about when we first sat down to plan the next major version of Application Craft, and has continued to be at the very heart of almost everything we are building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is arguably the single biggest advantage when using software in the browser, because the browser is constantly connected via the internet, and because the browser is now the most used application on almost any device. Collaboration is also hugely important when writing software and especially when building for the web. It empowers us to do more, while remaining in the [virtual] company of our friends and colleague&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of collaborating between you and others when using the browser and the internet are zero. Email, Twitter, Skype - these are all free to use, and they are all about collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.&amp;quot; - Charles Darwin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but now I hear a few of you asking the question &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;what if I don&amp;#39;t have anyone to collaborate with?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. The answer to that is easy and simple... &lt;strong&gt;you do!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is full of like-minded people just like you. People who love building web apps, designing web sites, or creating mobile applications. And they all have something to share, even you! And whether you realise it or not, you co-ordinate and collaborate every single day, with people you have never met or spoken to before. No matter what accomplishments you make, somebody helped you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest sites are essentially all about encouraging collaboration and making it easier for us to co-ordinate with each other. Sites and apps like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Wikipedia, Github, Basecamp, and now Application Craft are leading the way here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; powerful, and we think you&amp;#39;re going to love what you will be able to do with &lt;a href="http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/"&gt;what we have planned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Introducing Creighton University&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like to round up different perspectives of various Application Craft users and were pleased when Dr. Cindy Corritore, a Professor of IT in the &lt;a href="http://business.creighton.edu/"&gt;College of Business at Creighton University&lt;/a&gt;, offered her insights on what it has been like to teach with Application Craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Teaching mobile app development with Application Craft&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been teaching for about 25 years, and hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science (which I have also taught). My programming is rusty, and I was never a crack programmer. I am more interested in HCI (human-computer interaction, UX). I want to tell you a bit about how I used Application Craft (AC) in a new undergraduate course – with great success, I might add. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever tried to teach programming to business IT students you know the challenge I faced. While some IT students love to program, most do not. In fact, it appears that they have heard horrible things about programming since birth, and have to date successfully avoided it. I was tasked with developing a course that would teach them about programming. The goals for the course were not to develop programmers – but to teach students the language of the world of programming, the inherent difficulties with programming projects, and what it really took to put together something reasonable. I decided to use a hands-on approach, and to focus on apps. I thought students would be excited about developing apps – the cool factor. I searched for a long time for an appropriate IDE – and luckily found the perfect tool, Application Craft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application Craft was perfect for several reasons. First, it was an online IDE – so it was platform-independent, both for development and for final device deployment. Second, it was developed for teams – and a class fits that description perfectly. Third, it was a real-world tool. That meant you could do meaningful and significant projects with it, the students could put it on their resumes, they could take it with them into business when they graduated, and companies would be interested in it and the students’ work with it. AC could also be used at different levels. For students who wanted to develop very complex apps, AC was more than up to the task. However, it was also the perfect IDE for students who needed to work at a more basic level, yet produce something that ‘worked’. Finally, the creators of AC had developed an extensive set of tutorial videos, user manuals, and an active forum to bring myself as well as my students up to speed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, the best thing about AC was the ability to develop at a high level using widgets and properties as well as to interact directly with the code. This is the perfect learning environment as you can start high-level to build confidence, then dive into the code when students want to do more with their apps. It was also very easy for me to help them, as I could access their apps in our shared team account. Yet their work was not accessible by other students. I plan to use AC for this course in the future. I hope to add features to the course such as using databases and custom widgets as soon as I learn it. AC is a great product, one of a kind, and I see it as a professional, commercial tool that can also double in education. I can’t say enough good things about it, but am so happy that we were able to use it in the course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the students loved AC. They said it was the best part of the course. They took to it quickly and became very good at developing with it within a couple of weeks. This was true of students who did love to program, and of those who did not. It taught them to program just enough for me, let them experience the programs of development such as project management, deadlines, having ideas that then had to be implemented with code, and most of all, team work. One student, Mike Wieger, described it well in his &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/b2nsn7d"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Argy Bargy Event&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the students was so good that we decided to have a competition, with awards for the team built the ‘best’ apps. Our “2013 App Dev Argy-Bargy” was a huge success – it was attended by other students, folks from IT companies around the city, and the press. The top two teams won iPads and Google Nexus tablets, sponsored by businesses, including AC. It was an exciting event, with judges and audience voting via SMS. My favorite part? When a student said, in response to a question, that “we used an IDE called Application Craft, which is platform-independent, device-agnostic, had a great API, and allows for native implementation on devices.&amp;quot; Huh – three months ago these students wouldn’t have known the difference between IDE and API – that is, IMHO. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while ago I wrote about &lt;a href="/blog/2012/10/worlds-first-full-featured-ide/"&gt;what an IDE really is&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, we&amp;#39;ve been thinking hard and working even harder to realise that dream of a real IDE in the browser, and one that can go head to head with any desktop IDE. This is not without its challenges, so I wanted to write a little about how we are tackling these challenges head on, and to reveal a little more about something BIG that we announced &lt;a href="/blog/2013/01/something-big-is-coming/"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;From the Desktop...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets start by talking a little bit about the current state of the IDE landscape, which, to be honest is pretty bleak. On the desktop, the space is dominated by the likes of Adobe&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/dreamweaver"&gt;Dreamweaver&lt;/a&gt; and the open source &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse IDE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreamweaver is traditionally the kind of tool that new, fresh faced developers start with. I remember it was the IDE that I used to build my very first website back in 1998, and I also remember the god-awful and monstrous HTML markup it produced when publishing or exporting your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreamweaver has moved on greatly since then (it has had to) and now outputs shiny clean markup. It&amp;#39;s support for web standards has also greatly improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreamweaver has a large community around it, which has helped to create its large library of widgets, making it easy to add commonly used components into your pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipse is an altogether different beast, which is due largely to it being an open source project. This means it has a huge community of users and developers building in and on it. Whatever you are building, you can be sure that there is an Eclipse plugin that will help you out with your task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Eclipse can be very heavy at times, and is certainly not very friendly for those of you who are new to the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage to Eclipse and almost all IDE&amp;#39;s lies in its extensibility. The ability for any developer to extend and customise his/her tools is extremely powerful and very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;To the Browser...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desktop will always be with us, but like any platform, it has its limitations and its traditions. All of which can be very hard to counter. The desktop is also much slower to react to the changing pace of development and technology. The browser however, is an open door, and moves extremely fast when it comes to embracing the latest and greatest, which means it is now possible to emulate the power of the desktop right within your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The browser is deeply embedded into our digital lives and is the most used desktop application by far. So it stands to reason that we are seeing more and more desktop applications now moving into the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDE is no exception. However, no-one has yet managed to replicate the good parts of the desktop IDE&amp;#39;s in the browser. Well... that is until &lt;a href="http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;It&amp;#39;s a Big Task, but someone has to do it!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Something BIG is coming! &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Find out more...&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;" alt="Something BIG!" src="/img/blog/something-big-053c1ff0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re building an IDE that any type of developer will love to use on a day-to-day basis. A code editor that has all the functionality of the best desktop editors, including code-completion, split-panes and live preview. A development environment that can compete with the best desktop IDE&amp;#39;s, and support the basics, along with the most advanced features, such as source control, debugging, compilation/building, and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we&amp;#39;re adding a layer of convenience on top of all this, that will use the expertise that we have built into the current version of AC, empowering novices and the less technical of you to build web and mobile apps extremely fast. Including a widget library that you can use with a simple and drag and drop, and a pixel perfect layout manager to allow you to design your app in an extremely easy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are making sure that you can work the way you want to work, which means building an IDE that is extendable and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of this has your juices flowing, then we want you to &lt;a href="http://crafted.applicationcraft.com/"&gt;join in the fun&lt;/a&gt;. Something big is coming...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that with a click of a button, we will compile your AC and HTML5 apps for the Windows Phone platform. This is added at no additional cost, and sits alongside our current support for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/product/phonegap-mobile-build/"&gt;AC Mobile Build&lt;/a&gt; is based on the open source PhoneGap/Cordova project, and is designed to allow you to build apps using HTML, CSS and Javascript, while taking advantage of device specific functionality. You can then deploy them to any iOS, Android and now Windows Phone devices, and subsequently to their respective App Stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And AC Mobile Build is not only for AC apps. Just upload any web app, and we will do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy this new addition. And if you do, you&amp;#39;re gonna love what else we&amp;#39;ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
