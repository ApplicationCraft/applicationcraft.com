&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Mobile Build support for Windows Phone" alt="Windows Phone" src="/img/blog/winphone-37269549.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that with a click of a button, we will compile your AC and HTML5 apps for the Windows Phone platform. This is added at no additional cost, and sits alongside our current support for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/product/phonegap-mobile-build/"&gt;AC Mobile Build&lt;/a&gt; is based on the open source PhoneGap/Cordova project, and is designed to allow you to build apps using HTML, CSS and Javascript, while taking advantage of device specific functionality. You can then deploy them to any iOS, Android and now Windows Phone devices, and subsequently to their respective App Stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And AC Mobile Build is not only for AC apps. Just upload any web app, and we will do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy this new addition. And if you do, you&amp;#39;re gonna love what else we&amp;#39;ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over Christmas we introduced the easiest yet way for you to to create, read, update and delete data in any AC application. We partnered up with &lt;a href="http://parse.com"&gt;Parse&lt;/a&gt; to provide an extremely low barrier to entry data backend using their &lt;a href="https://parse.com/docs/rest#objects"&gt;Objects API&lt;/a&gt;. Making the whole &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"&gt;CRUD&lt;/a&gt; process amazingly easy to implement into any app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into too much detail here as the &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/parse/objects/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; already does that well. So instead I will prove to you you just how easy it is to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Available Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have created a new &lt;code&gt;parse.objects&lt;/code&gt; class which your app has access to. This new class contains 5 methods which cover everything you need to create, read, update and delete data, as well as a powerful querying API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectcreate"&gt;parse.objects.create()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectread"&gt;parse.objects.read()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectupdate"&gt;parse.objects.update()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectdelete"&gt;parse.objects.delete()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-api/parse-object/objectquery"&gt;parse.objects.query()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Example Scenario&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep a record of my book collection, including details of each book. So lets start by creating an object (or record) for each book in my collection (I only have one right now):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.create(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, {
  title: &amp;#39;The Lord of the Rings&amp;#39;,
  author: &amp;#39;JRR Tolkien&amp;#39;
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return a Javascript object containing the &lt;code&gt;objectId&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;createdAt&lt;/code&gt; date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  objectId: &amp;quot;DM5XhFTiPR&amp;quot;,
  createdAt: &amp;quot;2013-01-14T11:41:24.174Z&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot to add the publication date, so let&amp;#39;s update my record:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.update(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;DM5XhFTiPR&amp;#39;, {
  publishedAt: &amp;quot;1954-07-21T00:00:00.000Z&amp;quot;
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look at our updated object using the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.read(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;DM5XhFTiPR&amp;#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our object now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  title: &amp;#39;The Lord of the Rings&amp;#39;,
  author: &amp;#39;JRR Tolkien&amp;#39;,
  publishedAt: &amp;#39;1954-07-21T00:00:00.000Z&amp;#39;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that my wife just threw away my book, so I now need to delete this object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.delete(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;DM5XhFTiPR&amp;#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But being a good wife that she is, she bought me a shiny new replacement, along with a few others for me to read. So I created a new record for each of my new books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have quite a few books in collection, but want to find only those written by JRR Tolkien:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse.objects.query(&amp;#39;books&amp;#39;, {
  where: {
    author: &amp;#39;JRR Tolkien&amp;#39;
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above will return me a &lt;code&gt;results&lt;/code&gt; array, containing all objects which have an author of &amp;#39;JRR Tolkien&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the basics, and there is of course a lot more that you can do, including some pretty advanced querying. But you should be able to see from the above how quick and easy it is to use the new Parse powered database support in Application Craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/developers/documentation/product-guide/advanced-features/parse/"&gt;Check out the docs&lt;/a&gt; for more, and leave your comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have just completed full support for Push Notifications in Application Craft, and have teamed up with &lt;a href="http://www.xtify.com"&gt;Xtify&lt;/a&gt;, who provide the underlying push technology. You will need to create an Account with them, although this is free (you start paying Xtify once you reach large volumes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also added a new drop-in API that makes it ridiculously easy to add support for push notifications in your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How easy? Well this is all it takes ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create an App in Application Craft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create an App in Xtify for &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/configuration/iOS/xtify-ios-portal-setup/"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/configuration/android/xtify-android-portal-setup/"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You generate your iOS / Android keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You add the following code to your App&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function notificationReceived() {
    // Your own, optional callback function
    // Called when your App receives the notification
}

function handler_application_onAppStarted(){
    xtify.applicationKeyiOS = &amp;quot;12345678-9754-4ffc-be65-ecd00a482269&amp;quot;;
    xtify.applicationKeyAndroid = &amp;quot;abcdefg-9754-4ffc-be65-ecd00a482269&amp;quot;;
    xtify.startedCallback = notificationReceived;
    xtify.init();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You send out the Notification from &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/xtify-push-message/"&gt;Xtify&lt;/a&gt;, or from your own App using &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/ac-mobile-build-phonegap/ac-mobile-build/ac-build-plugins/xtify-push-notifications/apis/xtify-notification-api/"&gt;our API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;The AC Xtify API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have added our own API that sits in front of the Xtify system and makes life really very easy for you. However, you can always access the Xtify API directly if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of this are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease-of-use is at the top of the list; less experienced developers may struggle with Xtify&amp;#39;s own API and so we have simplified things for all common operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows you to operate in test mode, so you can test lots of things from your desktop rather than a mobile device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single call &amp;#39;xtify.location.update()&amp;#39; that automatically tells the Xtify system where the user is located. You can then set up auto notifications based on a user&amp;#39;s location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cool &amp;#39;Tag API&amp;#39; that lets your App tag users with any information you require, typically information gathered from the App itself. You can then send out notifications only to those users with certain tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sylvain Danigo has come up with an app using Application Craft that will transform the way citizens can interact with the Canadian town of Blainville. The mobile app, named &lt;a href="http://www.gjigan.com/"&gt;GjiGan&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced Jee-Gan), provides smartphone users both commercial and municipal information in real time. We had a chance to speak with Sylvain about the creation of GjiGan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_0"&gt;Tell us more about GjiGan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GjiGan is more than just a simple directory. The application presents news in real time, whether it’s municipal information, promotions, offers from local merchants, and even job listings. The application can be customized according to the type of information selected and your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app extracts news from the town’s official website so only the current and official news appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_1"&gt;Sounds great! What has the user response been like?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 600 users (the app was launched last month). Citizens like it because it’s a free app and gives them the town’s current information and includes interesting features, such as interactive maps. Businesses like it because it gives them a chance to promote and advertise on the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_2"&gt;Why did you choose Application Craft?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make mobile apps a year ago and looked at various platforms. The first thing that pulled me towards Application Craft was the fact that it is cloud-based. It’s easy to build screens and works immediately on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_3"&gt;What was your favourite aspect of Application Craft?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the drag and drop. I found it easy to quickly build what I wanted. Had I chosen a different platform it would have taken me twice the amount of time, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the widgets easy to program, enjoyed the many functionalities Application Craft has to offer and think Application Craft is very good value for what it offers and what I’ve been able to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things even better, I found the support great! The forum was a good place to ask questions and I received answers very quickly, either by the Application Craft staff or from other people on the forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_4"&gt;Any future Application Craft plans?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, I have another project lined up and have many customers asking for mobile development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_5"&gt;One last question... How did you come up with GjiGan’s name?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gjigan” means village in the Micmac* language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full case study can be found &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/pdf/testimonials/AC%20Case%20Study%20GjiGan.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Here’s a little Canadian history lesson for you: Micmacs are a First Nations people, located in Canada’s Maritime Provinces and the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec, as well as some parts of New England, USA. “Micmac” both refers to the people themselves and the language they speak. The Micmac were among the first peoples to be affected by European activities in the New World and underwent early depopulation and sociocultural disruption. Quick lesson over!&lt;/p&gt;
