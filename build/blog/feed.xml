    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Friday we shipped quite a large new release which I think is worth mentioning. As well as some significant bugs being squashed, we upgraded jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI, and integrated the Weinre Mobile Debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;jQuery Mobile and UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jQuery Mobile is one of the core parts of AC, and every single app uses at least some part of the open source framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in October, the team behind jQuery &lt;a href="http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/10/02/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-0-final/"&gt;released a major new version; 1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release brings a new popup widget, an autodivider and collapsible option for listviews, and over 100 enhancements and fixes throughout the library to make things smoother, faster, and more polished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/10/02/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-0-final/"&gt;Check out the blog post&lt;/a&gt; for a run down of what&amp;#39;s new in jQuery Mobile 1.2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of AC now includes this latest and greatest version of jQuery, and also because of it&amp;#39;s reliance on jQuery UI, we&amp;#39;ve included the latest version of that into this release too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Mobile Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also shipped a new feature to allow you to debug your apps right within the devices you are developing for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinre (Pronounced like the word &amp;quot;winery&amp;quot;) is a debugger for web pages, like FireBug (for FireFox) and Web Inspector (for WebKit-based browsers), except it&amp;#39;s designed to work remotely, and in particular, to allow you debug web pages on a mobile device such as a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Weinre Debugging" src="/img/blog/weinre-55f96c1d.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AC Weinre Debugging server lets you use the familiar webkit developer tools to debug your mobile web apps, and is yet another way that we are making it easier to build apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check it out at &lt;a href="http://mobile-build-debug.applicationcraft.com/"&gt;http://mobile-build-debug.applicationcraft.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Application Craft VS Appcelerator Titanium</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/blog/2012/12/application-craft-vs-appcelerator-titanium/"/>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We received an interesting question a few days ago. Someone asked us what advantages Application Craft has over Appcelerator&amp;#39;s Titanium. I thought it was a really good question, and one that I wanted to explore a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We received an interesting question a few days ago. Someone asked us what advantages Application Craft has over Appcelerator&amp;#39;s Titanium. I thought it was a really good question, and one that I wanted to explore a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;100% Cloud Based&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first biggest advantage over Titanium and most other development platforms, is that AC is 100% cloud based. From the moment you &lt;a href="/get-started"&gt;sign up for the free trial&lt;/a&gt;, right through to [optionally] compiling and running your finished application, the whole experience requires nothing more than your favourite browser and an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our web based console and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are all that is needed to build any kind of app that you wish. Titanium can have quite a few requirements, including Java, Python, Android SDK&amp;#39;s, Apple xCode (if you have a Mac).  You even have to download the Titanium IDE! Download an IDE?! It&amp;#39;s not 1999 you know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AC there is no requirement for you to download or install anything at all. Your browser is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Visual Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second big advantage to building your apps with AC, is that you can do so with very little code. In most cases, all you need to do is drag and drop a widget here and there, and then plumb these together using our simple events system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widgets are at the heart of any AC app, and we have dozens of them for you to use. From simple label and text widgets, to full-on charting. Every single one of these are simply dragged and dropped onto a page in your app, and configured to your requirements by setting a few properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you need to write some code, you can do so using the integrated code editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a Titanium app definately requires a lot technical experience and knowledge, which is something that we have worked hard to reduce for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;We host your apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are building a web app, we will host it at no extra cost to you. No need to find and pay for a web hosting provider, and no need to setup and configure your hosting. You save your app, and its hosted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;Mobile Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to release your apps on mobile and tablet devices via the app stores, you can do that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one click, &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/product/phonegap-mobile-build/"&gt;AC Mobile Build&lt;/a&gt; will build and compile your web app for use as a native mobile app, opening up the device features to you, along with a host of plugins that will add even more functionality to your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Server Side Javascript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can do almost anything with client side code, there may come a time when you need the power and security of a server. &lt;a href="/developers/documentation/scripting-apis/server-side-scripting-overview/"&gt;Server-Side-Javascript (SSJ)&lt;/a&gt; allows you to write Javascript code which is then run on the server, and makes it even easier to work with data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on, but I&amp;#39;ll save the smaller differences for another day. But hopefully, you can see that there are some pretty amazing advantages to using Application Craft, and you can &lt;a href="/get-started"&gt;enjoy them all for only $14 per month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’ve undergone lots of changes at Application Craft within the past month but we’re not going to take off our construction helmets and set our tools down just yet because there’s still lots of work to be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We constantly receive feedback and suggestions for improvements and new features and we’re happy to tell you that your requests are not being lost on us! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You suggested &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/10/accepting-credit-card-payments-ac-apps/"&gt;credit card payments&lt;/a&gt;, we thought, “why not?” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We heard the call out for &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/07/scandit-partnership-enterprise-quality-barcode-scanning-application-craft/"&gt;barcode scanning&lt;/a&gt;, in came our &lt;a href="http://www.scandit.com/"&gt;Scandit&lt;/a&gt; Partnership. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You asked for improved &lt;a href="http://www.scandit.com/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, you got it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We like to keep the lines of communication open between you and us, so we were beyond excited to introduce a new method of connecting with us via &lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/11/a-new-way-to-talk/"&gt;Intercom.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received such a great response from the latter that it made us think about what else we could do to improve your Application Craft experience. And thus the idea to host webinars was born. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Webinars!!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to organize regular webinar sessions where we will run through sessions that go through the basics of how to navigate around the console and IDE, to demonstrating how new features work. This is your chance to have some fun and interact with the Application Craft team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first webinar sessions will take place next week and will act as a mini one-hour tutorial session for those who would like a better understanding of the Application Craft product.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday December 11, 2012 - 2-3PM GMT&lt;br&gt;
Thursday December 13, 2012 - 6-7PM GMT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/#upcoming-webinars"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; now - We would love it if you came along and joined us! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazingly Easy Authentication with OAuth</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/blog/2012/12/oauth-support/"/>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently added &lt;a href="http://oauth.net/"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt; support to Application Craft, and in the usual Application Craft way, we&amp;#39;ve made it amazingly simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently provide explicit support for Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox but we&amp;#39;ll soon be adding support for more OAuth providers, as well as allowing you to make your own OAuth definitions so any service that supports OAuth can be defined in the AC Console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently added &lt;a href="http://oauth.net/"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt; support to Application Craft, and in the usual Application Craft way, we&amp;#39;ve made it amazingly simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently provide explicit support for Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox but we&amp;#39;ll soon be adding support for more OAuth providers, as well as allowing you to make your own OAuth definitions so any service that supports OAuth can be defined in the AC Console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Authentication for your Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the simpler uses for OAuth is to provide access to your App. You let a 3rd party service like Twitter or Facebook handle the login process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentication is as easy as shown below. You call &lt;code&gt;OAuthSignIn()&lt;/code&gt; and that&amp;#39;s it. The service pops up in a browser window, handles the login and returns an access token. You can store that token in a cookie so when your users access your App in the future, they don&amp;#39;t have to login again (until the service decides to expire it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function handler_btnAuth_onClick(mouseev){
  // See if we already have an old Access Token
  _accessToken = app.getCookie(&amp;quot;myTwitterSession&amp;quot;);
  if (_accessToken === null || _accessToken === &amp;quot;&amp;quot;) {
    // No, we don&amp;#39;t have one so get a new one
    app.OAuthSignIn(&amp;#39;twitter&amp;#39;, authCallback);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Calling OAuth secured APIs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get much more interesting when you want to access APIs from services such as Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox. Using our OAuth support, you can access the full functionality of those services in a way that is remarkably easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short example shows the code for sending a Tweet via Twitter. It is actually made up of two parts - the code running on the client ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function handler_btnTweet_onClick(mouseev){
    app.callSSJ(&amp;#39;sendTweet&amp;#39;, function(error, data){
  if(error) {
    // Some error occurred (maybe the 
    // Access Token has expired)
  } else {
    app.showMessage(&amp;quot;OAuth Demo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Message successfully tweeted!&amp;quot;);  
  }
}, [_accessToken, txtTweetMessage]);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and the server side code that gets called by &lt;code&gt;app.callSSJ()&lt;/code&gt; in the above example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function sendTweet(accessToken, txtTweet) {
ssj.OAuthRequest(accessToken, 
    &amp;#39;https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json&amp;#39;,    
    &amp;#39;POST&amp;#39;, { status: txtTweet });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen OAuth handled that straightforward? Application Craft does all the dirty work and heavy lifting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ahoy everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the many website changes we’ve been working hard at improving, such as fixing video links and cleaning up our &lt;a title="Application Craft Documentation blog" href="http://www.applicationcraft.com/blog/2012/11/documentation-search-and-full-screen/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, we went ahead and added in another something extra to make your life easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your time’s valuable! We know that and you know that, which is why we have created an app so you can access Application Craft directly from Chrome. This 2-step process will save you time to do more important things... such as creating applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go on the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/application-craft/fnbfgfpielckjhdohmkacklnnjkdpkdc/"&gt;Chrome Web Store&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the ‘Add to Chrome’ tab. This will allow you to bypass signing in via the website, as having the Chrome app will have you on your way to smooth sailing directly to your personal console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Add to Chrome" src="/img/blog/1addchrome-df91bbda.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ta da! Now the app will appear on your Chrome homepage. All done, told you it was easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AC in Chrome" src="/img/blog/2acapp-4dbd44bf.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 100 users using the Chrome app we invite you to jump on board to join the other happy crafters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions? Just &lt;a href="mailto:support@applicationcraft.com"&gt;give us a holler&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ta ta for now,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_1"&gt;&lt;a href="/developers/documentation/my-first-app/"&gt;Click here to see it live &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we released our new web site, Joel also built a new framework for our all our documentation. We just finished all the major tweaks and so we are now using it for a complete set of tutorials, My First App being the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;8 Steps, 15 Minutes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 8 easy steps and about 15 minutes of work, you get to build and deploy an App but you really get to play with most of the major components of Application Craft, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;designing a very simple UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing some code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;Coming soon ...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My First App is the first part of some major tutorial work. The main ones we are about to start work on are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a complete set of &lt;strong&gt;Javascript for Beginners&lt;/strong&gt; tutorials that use Application Craft as a great way to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a comprehensive collection of &lt;strong&gt;Application Craft By Example&lt;/strong&gt; tutorials, which will conentrate on getting into the really meaty aspects of using the product with lots of detailed examples. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Feedback Please!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please add your commments to this blog. We really do take notice so any ideas, suggestions, typo spots (etc.) are much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
